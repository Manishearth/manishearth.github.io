  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Julia Evans wrote an <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/12/23/segfault-debugging/">excellent post</a> about debugging a segfault in Rust. (Go read it, it&rsquo;s good)</p>

<p>One thing it mentioned was</p>

<blockquote><p>I think “undefined” and “unsafe” are considered to be synonyms.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is &hellip; incorrect. However, we in the Rust community have never really explicitly outlined the
distinction, so that confusion is on us! This blog post is an attempt to clarify the difference of
terminology as used within the Rust community. It&rsquo;s a very useful but subtle distinction and I feel we&rsquo;d be
able to talk about safety more expressively if this was well known.</p>

<h2>Unsafe means two things in Rust, yay</h2>

<p>So, first off, the waters are a bit muddied by the fact that Rust uses <code>unsafe</code> to both mean &ldquo;within
an <code>unsafe {}</code> block&rdquo; and &ldquo;something Bad is happening here&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s possible to have safe code
within an <code>unsafe</code> block; indeed this is the <em>primary function</em> of an <code>unsafe</code> block. Somewhat
counterintutively, the <code>unsafe</code> block&rsquo;s purpose is to actually tell the compiler &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t
like this code but trust me, it&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo; (where &ldquo;safe&rdquo; is the negation of the <em>second</em> meaning of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;something Bad is not happening here&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Similarly, we use &ldquo;safe code&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;code not using <code>unsafe{}</code> blocks&rdquo; but also &ldquo;code that is not unsafe&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;code where nothing bad happens&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This blog post is primarily about the &ldquo;something bad is happening here&rdquo; meaning of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;. When referring
to the other kind I&rsquo;ll specifically say &ldquo;code within <code>unsafe</code> blocks&rdquo; or something like that.</p>

<h2>Undefined behavior</h2>

<p>In languages like C, C++, and Rust, undefined behavior is when you reach a point where
the compiler is allowed to do anything with your code. This is distinct from implementation-defined
behavior, where usually a given compiler/library will do a deterministic thing, however they have some
freedom from the spec in deciding what that thing is.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior can be pretty scary. This is usually because in practice it causes problems when
the compiler assumes &ldquo;X won&rsquo;t happen because it is undefined behavior&rdquo;, and X ends up happening,
breaking the assumptions. In some cases this does nothing dangerous, but often the compiler will
end up doing wacky things to your code. Dereferencing a null pointer will <em>sometimes</em> cause segfaults
(which is the compiler generating code that actually dereferences the pointer, making the kernel
complain), but sometimes it will be optimized in a way that assumes it won&rsquo;t and moves around code
such that you have major problems.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior is a global property, based on how your code is <em>used</em>. The following function
in C++ or Rust may or may not exhibit undefined behavior, based on how it gets used:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As long as you always call it with a valid pointer to an integer, there is no undefined behavior
involved.</p>

<p>But in either language, if you use it with some pointer conjured out of thin air (like <code>0x01</code>), that&rsquo;s
probably undefined behavior.</p>

<p>As it stands, UB is a property of the entire program and its execution. Sometimes you may have snippets of code
that will always exhibit undefined behavior regardless of how they are called, but in general UB
is a global property.</p>

<h2>Unsafe behavior</h2>

<p>Rust&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;unsafe behavior&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m coining this term because &ldquo;unsafety&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsafe code&rdquo; can
be a bit confusing) is far more scoped. Here, <code>fn deref</code> <em>is</em> &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, even if you <em>always</em>
call it with a valid pointer. The reason it is still unsafe is because it&rsquo;s possible to trigger UB by only
changing the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; caller code. I.e. &ldquo;changes to code outside unsafe blocks can trigger UB if they include
calls to this function&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Basically, in Rust a bit of code is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; if it cannot exhibit undefined behavior under all circumstances of
that code being used. The following code exhibits &ldquo;safe behavior&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;{}&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">raw</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We dereferenced a raw pointer, but we knew it was valid. Of course, actual <code>unsafe</code> blocks will
usually be &ldquo;actually totally safe&rdquo; for less obvious reasons, and part of this is because
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/working-with-unsafe.html#working-with-unsafe"><code>unsafe</code> blocks sometimes can pollute the entire module</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in Rust is a more local property. Code isn&rsquo;t safe just because you only use it in
a way that doesn&rsquo;t trigger UB, it is safe because there is literally <em>no way to use it such that it
will do so</em>. No way to do so without using <code>unsafe</code> blocks, that is<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a distinction that&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> to draw in Rust because it gives us the ability
to compartmentalize safety. Trying to apply this definition to C++ is problematic; you can
ask &ldquo;is <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> safe?&rdquo;, but you can <em>always</em> use it within code in a way that you trigger
undefined behavior, because C++ does not have the tools for compartmentalizing safety. The distinction
between &ldquo;code which doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about safety&rdquo; and &ldquo;code which does need to worry about safety&rdquo;
exists in Rust in the form of &ldquo;code outside of <code>unsafe {}</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;code within <code>unsafe {}</code>&rdquo;, whereas in
C++ it&rsquo;s a lot fuzzier and based on expectations (and documentation/the spec).</p>

<p>So C++&rsquo;s <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the sense that it does what you expect but
if you use it in a way counter to how it&rsquo;s <em>supposed</em> to be used (constructing one from an invalid pointer, for example)
it can blow up. This is still a useful sense of safety, and is how one regularly reasons about safety in C++. However it&rsquo;s not
the same sense of the term as used in Rust, which can be a bit more formal about what the expectations
actually are.</p>

<p>So <code>unsafe</code> in Rust is a strictly more general concept &ndash; all code exhibiting undefined behavior in Rust is also &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;,
however not all &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; code in Rust exhibits undefined behavior as written in the current program.</p>

<p>Rust furthermore attempts to guarantee that you will not trigger undefined behavior if you do not use <code>unsafe {}</code> blocks.
This of course depends on the correctness of the compiler (it has bugs) and of the libraries you use (they may also have bugs)
but this compartmentalization gets you most of the way there in having UB-free programs.</p>

<p>Once again in we have a slight difference between an &ldquo;<code>unsafe fn</code>&rdquo;, i.e. a function that needs an <code>unsafe</code> block to call and probably is unsafe, and an &ldquo;unsafe function&rdquo;, a function that exhibits unsafe behavior.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-size"><code>font-size</code></a> is the worst.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a CSS property probably everyone who writes CSS has used at some point. It&rsquo;s pretty ubiquitous.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s <em>super</em> complicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just a number&rdquo;, you say. &ldquo;How can that be complicated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I too felt that way one time. And then I worked on implementing it for <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Stylo">stylo</a>.</p>

<p>Stylo is the project to integrate <a href="http://github.com/servo/servo/">Servo</a>&rsquo;s styling system into Firefox. The styling system handles
parsing CSS, determining which rules apply to which elements, running this through the cascade,
and eventually computing and assigning styles to individual elements in the tree. This happens not
only on page load, but also whenever various kinds of events (including DOM manipulation) occur,
and is a nontrivial portion of pageload and interaction times.</p>

<p>Servo is in <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, and makes use of Rust&rsquo;s safe parallelism in many places, one of them being
styling. Stylo has the potential to bring these speedups into Firefox, along with the added safety
of the code being in a safer systems language.</p>

<p>Anyway, as far as the styling system is concerned, I believe that font-size is the most complex
property it has to handle. Some properties may be more complicated when it comes to layout or
rendering, but font-size is probably the most complex one in the department of styling.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this post can give an idea of how complex the Web can <em>get</em>, and also serve as documentation
for some of these complexities. I&rsquo;ll also try to give an idea of how the styling system works throughout this post.</p>

<p>Alright. Let&rsquo;s see what is so complex about font-size.</p>

<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>The syntax of the property is pretty straightforward. You can specify it as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A length (<code>12px</code>, <code>15pt</code>, <code>13em</code>, <code>4in</code>, <code>8rem</code>)</li>
<li>A percentage (<code>50%</code>)</li>
<li>A compound of the above, via a calc (<code>calc(12px + 4em + 20%)</code>)</li>
<li>An absolute keyword (<code>medium</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>large</code>, <code>x-large</code>, etc)</li>
<li>A relative keyword (<code>larger</code>, <code>smaller</code>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The first three are common amongst quite a few length-related properties. Nothing abnormal in the syntax.</p>

<p>The next two are interesting. Essentially, the absolute keywords map to various pixel values, and match
the result of <code>&lt;font size=foo&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>size=3</code> is the same as <code>font-size: medium</code>). The <em>actual</em> value they map to
is not straightforward, and I&rsquo;ll get to that later in this post.</p>

<p>The relative keywords basically scale the size up or down. The mechanism of the scaling was also complex, however
this has changed. I&rsquo;ll get to that too.</p>

<h2>em and rem units</h2>

<p>First up: <code>em</code> units. One of the things you can specify in <em>any</em> length-based CSS property is a value with an <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>
unit.</p>

<p><code>5em</code> means &ldquo;5 times the <code>font-size</code> of the element this is applied to&rdquo;. <code>5rem</code> means &ldquo;5 times the font-size of the root element&rdquo;</p>

<p>The implications of this are that font-size needs to be computed before all the other properties (well, not quite, but we&rsquo;ll get to that!)
so that it is available during that time.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>em</code> units within <code>font-size</code> itself. In this case, it computed relative to the font-size of the <em>parent</em> element, since
you can&rsquo;t use the font-size of the element to compute itself. (This is identical to using a percentage unit)</p>

<h2>Minimum font size</h2>

<p>Browsers let you set a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; font size in their preferences, and text will not be scaled below it. It&rsquo;s useful for those with
trouble seeing small text.</p>

<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t affect properties which depend on font-size via <code>em</code> units. So if you&rsquo;re using a minimum font size,
<code>&lt;div style="font-size: 1px; height: 1em; background-color: red"&gt;</code> will have a very tiny height (which you&rsquo;ll notice from the color),
but the text will be clamped to the minimum size.</p>

<p>What this effectively means is that you need to keep track of <em>two</em> separate computed font size values. There&rsquo;s one value that
is used to actually determine the font size used for the text, and one value that is used whenever the style system needs to
know the font-size (e.g. to compute an <code>em</code> unit.)</p>

<p>This gets slightly more complicated when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character">ruby</a> is involved. In ideographic scripts (usually, Han
and Han-based scripts like Kanji or Hanja) it&rsquo;s sometimes useful to have the pronunciation
of each character above it in a phonetic script, for the aid of readers without proficiency in that
script, and this is known as &ldquo;ruby&rdquo; (&ldquo;furigana&rdquo; in Japanese). Because these scripts are ideographic,
it&rsquo;s not uncommon for learners to know the pronunciation of a word but have no idea how to write it.
An example would be <ruby><rb>日</rb><rt>に</rt><rb>本</rb><rt>ほん</rt></ruby>, which is 日本 (&ldquo;nihon&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;Japan&rdquo;) in Kanji with ruby にほん in the phonetic Hiragana script above it.</p>

<p>As you can probably see, the phonetic ruby text is in a smaller font size (usually 50% of the font
size of the main text<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>). The minimum font-size support <em>respects</em> this, and ensures that if the ruby
is supposed to be <code>50%</code> of the size of the text, the minimum font size for the ruby is <code>50%</code> of the
original minimum font size. This avoids clamped text from looking like <ruby><rb>日</rb><rt style="font-size: 1em">に</rt><rb>本</rb><rt style="font-size: 1em">ほん</rt></ruby> (where both get set to
the same size), which is pretty ugly.</p>

<h2>Text zoom</h2>

<p>Firefox additionally lets you zoom text only when zooming. If you have trouble reading small things, it&rsquo;s great to
be able to just blow up the text on the page without having the whole page get zoomed (which means you need to scroll
around a lot).</p>

<p>In this case, <code>em</code> units of other properties <em>do</em> get zoomed as well. After all, they&rsquo;re supposed to be relative to the text&rsquo;s font
size (and may have some relation to the text), so if that size has changed so should they.</p>

<p>(Of course, that argument could also apply to the min font size stuff. I don&rsquo;t have an answer for why it doesn&rsquo;t.)</p>

<p>This is actually pretty straightforward to implement. When computing absolute font sizes (including
keywords), zoom them if text zoom is on. For everything else continue as normal.</p>

<p>Text zoom is also disabled within <code>&lt;svg:text&gt;</code> elements, which leads to some trickiness here.</p>

<h2>Interlude: How the style system works</h2>

<p>Before I go ahead it&rsquo;s probably worth giving a quick overview of how everything works.</p>

<p>The responsibiltiy of a style system is to take in CSS code and a DOM tree, and assign computed styles to each element.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a distinction between &ldquo;specified&rdquo; and &ldquo;computed&rdquo; here. &ldquo;specified&rdquo; styles are in the format
you specify in CSS, whereas computed styles are those that get attached to the elements, sent to
layout, and inherited from. A given specified style may compute to different values when applied to
different elements.</p>

<p>So while you can <em>specify</em> <code>width: 5em</code>, it will compute to something like <code>width: 80px</code>. Computed values are usually a
cleaned up form of the specified value.</p>

<p>The style system will first parse the CSS, producing a bunch of rules usually containing declarations (a declaration is like <code>width: 20%;</code>; i.e. a property name and a specified value)</p>

<p>It then goes through the tree in top-down order (this is parallelized in Stylo), figuring out which declarations <em>apply</em> to each element
and in which order &ndash; some declarations have precedence over others. Then it will compute each relevant declaration against the element&rsquo;s style (and parent style, among other bits of info),
and store this value in the element&rsquo;s &ldquo;computed style&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of optimizations that Gecko and Servo do here to avoid duplicated work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. There&rsquo;s a
bloom filter for quickly checking if deep descendent selectors apply to a subtree. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;rule
tree&rdquo; that helps cache effort from determining applicable declarations. Computed styles are
reference counted and shared very often (since the default state is to inherit from the parent or
from the default style).</p>

<p>But ultimately, this is the gist of what happens.</p>

<h2>Keyword values</h2>

<p>Alright, this is where it gets complicated.</p>

<p>Remember when I said <code>font-size: medium</code> was a thing that mapped to a value?</p>

<p>So what does it map to?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out, it depends on the font family. For the following HTML:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font: medium monospace&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font: medium sans-serif&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<span style="font: medium monospace">text</span>
<span style="font: medium sans-serif">text</span>
</div>


<p>where the first one computes to a font-size of 13px, and the second one computes to a font-size of
16px. You can check this in the computed style pane of your devtools, or by using
<code>getComputedStyle()</code>.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> the reason behind this is that monospace fonts tend to be wider, so the default font size (medium)
is scaled so that they have similar widths, and all other keyword font sizes get shifted as well. The final result is something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/font-size-table.png" width="600" ></p>

<p>Firefox and Servo have <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/d415617a5bbe65a73bd805808a7ac76f38a1861c/components/style/properties/longhand/font.mako.rs#L763-L774">a matrix</a> that helps derive the values for all the absolute
font-size keywords based on the &ldquo;base size&rdquo; (i.e. the computed of <code>font-size: medium</code>). Actually,
Firefox has <a href="http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c329d562fb6c6218bdb79290faaf015467ef89e2/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#3272-3341">three tables</a> to support some legacy use cases like quirks mode (Servo has
yet to add support for these tables). We query other parts of the browser for what the &ldquo;base size&rdquo;
is based on the language and font family.</p>

<p>Wait, but what does the language have to do with this anyway? How does the language impact font-size?</p>

<p>It turns out that the base size depends on the font family <em>and</em> the language, and you can configure this.</p>

<p>Both Firefox and Chrome (using an extension) actually let you tweak which fonts get used on a per-language basis,
<em>as well as the default (base) font-size</em>.</p>

<p>This is not as obscure as one might think. Default system fonts are often really ugly for non-Latin-
using scripts. I have a separate font installed that produces better-looking Devanagari ligatures.</p>

<p>Similarly, some scripts are just more intricate than Latin. My default font size for Devanagari is
set to 18 instead of 16. I&rsquo;ve started learning Mandarin and I&rsquo;ve set that font size to 18 as well. Hanzi glyphs
can get pretty complicated and I still struggle to learn (and later recognize) them. A larger font size is great for this.</p>

<p>Anyway, this doesn&rsquo;t complicate things too much.  This does mean that the font family needs to be
computed before font-size, which already needs to be computed before most other properties. The
language, which can be set using a <code>lang</code> HTML attribute, is internally treated as a CSS property by
Firefox since it inherits, and it must be computed earlier as well.</p>

<p>Not too bad. So far.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s the kicker. This <em>dependence</em> on the language and family <em>inherits</em>.</p>

<p>Quick, what&rsquo;s the font-size of the inner <code>div</code>?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 16 --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    font size is 16px
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font-family: monospace&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 13 --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        font size is ??
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For a normal inherited CSS property<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, if the parent has a computed value of <code>16px</code>,
and the child has no additional values specified, the child will inherit a value of <code>16px</code>.
<em>Where</em> the parent got that computed value from doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>Here, <code>font-size</code> &ldquo;inherits&rdquo; a value of <code>13px</code>. You can see this below (<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MvorQQ">codepen</a>):</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<div style="font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"> <!-- base size 16 -->
    font size is 16px
    <div style="font-family: monospace"> <!-- base size 13 -->
        font size is ??
    </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Basically, if the computed value originated from a keyword, whenever the font family or language
change, font-size is recomputed from the original keyword with the new font family and language.</p>

<p>The reason this exists is because otherwise the differing font sizes wouldn&rsquo;t work anyway! The default font size
is <code>medium</code>, so basically the root element gets a <code>font-size: medium</code> and all elements inherit from it. If you change
to monospace or a different language in the document you need the font-size recomputed.</p>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t stop here. This even inherits <em>through relative units</em> (Not in IE).</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oewpER">codepen</a>)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<div style="font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"> <!-- base size 16 -->
    font size is 16px
    <div style="font-size: 0.9em"> <!-- could also be font-size: 90%-->
        font size is 14.4px (16 * 0.9)
        <div style="font-family: monospace"> <!-- base size 13 -->
            font size is 11.7px! (13 * 0.9)
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>So we&rsquo;re actually inheriting a font-size of <code>0.9*medium</code> when we inherit from the second div, not <code>14.4px</code>.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is whenever the font family or language changes, you should recompute the font-size as if the language and family <em>were always that way</em> up the tree.</p>

<p>Firefox code uses both of these strategies. The original Gecko style system handles this by actually
going back to the top of the tree and recalculating the font size as if the language/family were
different. I suspect this is inefficient, but the rule tree seems to be involved in making this slightly
more efficient</p>

<p>Servo, on the other hand, stores some extra data on the side when computing stuff, data which gets copied over to the child element. It basically
stores the equivalent of saying &ldquo;Yes, this font was computed from a keyword. The keyword was <code>medium</code>, and after that we applied a factor of 0.9 to it.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In both cases, this leads to a bunch of complexities in all the <em>other</em> font-size complexities, since they need to be carefully preserved through this.</p>

<p>In Servo, <em>most</em> of this gets handled <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/longhand/font.mako.rs#L964-L1061">via custom cascading functions for font-size</a>.</p>

<h2>Larger/smaller</h2>

<p>So I mentioned that <code>font-size: larger</code> and <code>smaller</code> scale the size, but didn&rsquo;t mention by what fraction.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#relative-size-value">to the spec</a>, if the font-size currently matches the value of an absolute keyword size (medium/large/etc),
you should pick the value of the next/previous keyword sizes respectively.</p>

<p>If it is <em>between</em> two, find the same point between the next/previous two sizes.</p>

<p>This, of course, must play well with the weird inheritance of keyword font sizes mentioned before. In Gecko&rsquo;s model this isn&rsquo;t too hard,
since Gecko recalculates things anyway. In Servo&rsquo;s model we&rsquo;d have to store a sequence of applications of <code>larger</code>/<code>smaller</code> and relative
units, instead of storing just a relative unit.</p>

<p>Additionally, when computing this during text-zoom, you have to unzoom before looking it up in the table, and then rezoom.</p>

<p>Overall, a bunch of complexity for not much gain &mdash; turns out only Gecko actually followed the spec here! All other browser engines
used simple ratios here.</p>

<p>So my fix here <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361550">was simply to remove this behavior from Gecko</a>. That simplified things.</p>

<h2>MathML</h2>

<p>Firefox and Safari support MathML, a markup language for math. It doesn&rsquo;t get used much on the Web these days, but it exists.</p>

<p>MathML has its own complexities when it comes to font-size. Specifically, <code>scriptminsize</code>, <code>scriptlevel</code>, and <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in MathML, the text in the numerator or denominator of a fraction or the text of a superscript is 0.71 times the size of the text outside of it. This is because
the default <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code> for MathML elements is 0.71, and these specific elements all get a default scriptlevel of <code>+1</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, <code>scriptlevel=+1</code> means &ldquo;multiply the font size by <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code>&rdquo;, and
<code>scriptlevel=-1</code> is for dividing. This can be specified via a <code>scriptlevel</code> HTML attribute on an <code>mstyle</code> element. You can
similarly tweak the (inherited) multiplier via the <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code> HTML attribute, and the minimum size via <code>scriptminsize</code>.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;mn&gt;</span>small superscript<span class="nt">&lt;/mn&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;math&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    text

</span><span class='line'>        small
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">+1</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>            smaller
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">-1</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>                small again
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/math&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will show as (you will need Firefox to see the rendered version, Safari supports MathML too but the support isn&rsquo;t as good):</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<math><msup><mi>text</mi><mn>small superscript</mn></msup></math><br>
<math>text<mstyle scriptlevel=+1> small <mstyle scriptlevel=+1> smaller <mstyle scriptlevel=-1> small again </mstyle></mstyle></mstyle></math>
</div>


<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BdZJgR">codepen</a>)</p>

<p>So this isn&rsquo;t as bad. It&rsquo;s as if <code>scriptlevel</code> is a weird <code>em</code> unit. No biggie, we know how to deal with those already.</p>

<p>Except you also have <code>scriptminsize</code>. This lets you set the minimum font size <em>for changes caused by <code>scriptlevel</code></em>.</p>

<p>This means that <code>scriptminsize</code> will make sure <code>scriptlevel</code> never causes changes that make the font smaller than the min size,
but it will ignore cases where you deliberately specify an <code>em</code> unit or a pixel value.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s already a subtle bit of complexity introduced here, <code>scriptlevel</code> now becomes another thing
that tweaks how <code>font-size</code> inherits. Fortunately, in Firefox/Servo internally <code>scriptlevel</code> (as are
<code>scriptminsize</code> and <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code>) is also handled as a CSS property, which means that we
can use the same framework we used for font-family and language here &ndash; compute the script
properties before font-size, and if <code>scriptlevel</code> is set, force-recalculate the font size even if
font-size itself was not set.</p>

<h3>Interlude: early and late computed properties</h3>

<p>In Servo the way we handle dependencies in properties is to have a set of &ldquo;early&rdquo; properties and a
set of &ldquo;late&rdquo; properties (which are allowed to depend on early properties). We iterate the
declarations twice, once looking for early properties, and once for late. However, now we have a
pretty intricate set of dependencies, where font-size must be calculated after language, font-family,
and the script properties, but before everything else that involves lengths. Additionally, font-family
has to be calculated after all the other early properties due to another font complexity I&rsquo;m not covering here.</p>

<p>The way we handle this is to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3195-L3204">pull font-size and font-family</a> out during the early computation,
but not deal with them until <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3211-L3327">after the early computation is done</a>.</p>

<p>At that stage we first <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3219-L3233">handle the disabling of text-zoom</a>, and then handle <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3235-L3277">the complexities of font-family</a>.</p>

<p>We then <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3280-L3303">compute the font family</a>. If a font size was specified, we <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3305-L3309">just compute that</a>. If it
was not, but a font family, lang, or scriptlevel was specified, we <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3310-L3324">force compute as inherited</a>, which handles all the constraints.</p>

<h3>Why scriptminsize gets complicated</h3>

<p>Unlike with the other &ldquo;minimum font size&rdquo;, using an <code>em</code> unit in any property will calculate the
length with the clamped value, not the &ldquo;if nothing had been clamped&rdquo; value, when the font size has
been clamped with scriptminsize. So at first glance handling this seems straightforward; only
consider the script min size when deciding to scale because of scriptlevel.</p>

<p>As always, it&rsquo;s not that simple 😀:</p>

<p>Basically, if you increase the level a bunch of times after hitting the min size, decreasing it by one should not immediately
compute <code>min size / multiplier</code>. That would make things asymmetric; something with a net script level of <code>+5</code> should
have the same size as something with a net script level of <code>+6 -1</code>, provided the multiplier hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>So what happens is that the script level is calculated against the font size <em>as if scriptminsize had never applied</em>,
and we only use that size if it is greater than the min size.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just a matter of keeping track of the script level at which clamping happened &ndash; the multiplier could change
in the process and you need to keep track of that too. So this ends up in creating <em>yet another font-size value to inherit</em>.</p>

<p>To recap, we are now at <em>four</em> different notions of font size being inherited:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main font size used by styling</li>
<li>The &ldquo;actual&rdquo; font size, i.e. the main font size but clamped by the min size</li>
<li>(In servo only) The &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; size; i.e. the size stored as a keyword and ratio, if it was derived from a keyword</li>
<li>The &ldquo;script unconstrained&rdquo; size; the font size as if scriptminsize never existed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another complexity here is that the following should still work:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/prwpVd">codepen</a>)</p>

<p>Basically, if you were already below the scriptminsize, reducing the script level (to increase the font size) should not get clamped, since then you&rsquo;d get something too large.</p>

<p>This basically means you only apply scriptminsize if you are applying the script level to a value <em>greater than</em> the script min size.</p>

<p>In Servo, all of the MathML handling culminates in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/gecko.mako.rs#L2304-L2403">this wonderful function that is more comment than code</a>, and
some code in the functions near it.</p>

<hr />

<p>So there you have it. <code>font-size</code> is actually pretty complicated. A lot of the web platform has hidden complexities like this, and it&rsquo;s always fun to encounter more of them.</p>

<p>(Perhaps less fun when I have to implement them 😂)</p>

<p>Interestingly, in Firefox, this number is 50% for all ruby <em>except</em> for when the language is Taiwanese Mandarin (where it is 30%). This is because Taiwan uses a phonetic script called Bopomofo, and each Han glyph can be represented as a maximum of 3 Bopomofo letters. So it is possible to choose a reasonable minimum size such that the ruby never extends the size of the glyph below it. On the other hand, pinyin can be up to six letters, and Hiragana up to (I think) 5, and the corresponding &ldquo;no overflow&rdquo; scaling will be too tiny. So fitting them on top of the glyph is not a consideration and instead we elect to have a larger font size for better readability. Additionally, Bopomofo ruby is often set on the side of the glyph instead of on top, and 30% works better there.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot these days. In part because of <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/issues/1737">an idea I had</a>
but also due to <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/863829482645340160">this twitter discussion</a>.</p>

<p>When teaching most things, there are two non-mutually-exclusive ways of approaching the problem. One
is &ldquo;proactive&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, which is where the teacher decides a learning path beforehand, and executes it. The
other is &ldquo;reactive&rdquo;, where the teacher reacts to the student trying things out and dynamically
tailors the teaching experience.</p>

<p>Most in-person teaching experiences are a mix of both. Planning beforehand is very important whilst teaching,
but tailoring the experience to the student&rsquo;s reception of the things being taught is important too.</p>

<p>In person, you <em>can</em> mix these two, and in doing so you get a &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; situation. Yay!</p>

<p>But &hellip; we don&rsquo;t really learn much programming in a classroom setup.
Sure, some folks learn the basics in college for a few years, but everything
they learn after that isn&rsquo;t in a classroom situation where this can work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
I&rsquo;m an autodidact,
and while I have taken a few programming courses for random interesting things, I&rsquo;ve taught myself most of what I know
using various sources. I care a lot about improving the situation here.</p>

<p>With self-driven learning we have a similar divide. The &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; model corresponds to reading books
and docs. Various people have proactively put forward a path for learning in the form of a book
or tutorial. It&rsquo;s up to you to pick one, and follow it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; model is not so well-developed. In the context of self-driven learning in programming,
it&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;do things, make mistakes, hope that Google/Stackoverflow help&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s how
a lot of people learn programming; and it&rsquo;s how I prefer to learn programming.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very nice to be able to &ldquo;learn along the way&rdquo;. While this is a long and arduous process,
involving many false starts and a lack of a sense of progress, it can be worth it in terms of
the kind of experience this gets you.</p>

<p>But as I mentioned, this isn&rsquo;t as well-developed. With the proactive approach, there still
is a teacher &ndash; the author of the book! That teacher may not be able to respond in real time,
but they&rsquo;re able to set forth a path for you to work through.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with the &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; approach, there is no teacher. Sure, there are
Random Answers on the Internet, which are great, but they don&rsquo;t form a coherent story.
Neither can you really be your own teacher for a topic you do not understand.</p>

<p>Yet plenty of folks do this. Plenty of folks approach things like learning a new language by reading
at most two pages of docs and then just diving straight in and trying stuff out. The only language I
have not done this for is the first language I learned<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s unfortunate that folks who prefer this approach don&rsquo;t get the benefit of a teacher.
In the reactive approach, teachers can still tell you what you&rsquo;re doing wrong and steer you away from
tarpits of misunderstanding. They can get you immediate answers and guidance. When we look
for answers on stackoverflow, we get some of this, but it also involves a lot of pattern-matching
on the part of the student, and we end up with a bad facsimile of what a teacher can do for you.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s possible to construct a better teacher for this!</p>

<p>In fact, examples of this exist in the wild already!</p>

<p>The Elm compiler is my favorite example of this. <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants">It has amazing error messages</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/elm-error.png" >
<img class="center" src="/images/post/elm-error2.png" ></p>

<p>The error messages tell you what you did wrong, sometimes suggest fixes, and help
correct potential misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Rust does this too. Many compilers do. (Elm is exceptionally good at it)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/rust-error.png" width="700" ></p>

<p>One thing I particularly like about Rust is that from that error you can
try <code>rustc --explain E0373</code> and get a terminal-friendly version
of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/error-index.html#E0373">this help text</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, diagnostics basically provide a reactive component to learning programming. I&rsquo;ve cared about
diagnostics in Rust for a long time, and I often remind folks that many things taught through the
docs can/should be taught through diagnostics too. Especially because diagnostics are a kind of soapbox
for compiler writers &mdash; you can&rsquo;t guarantee that your docs will be read, but you can guarantee
that your error messages will. These days, while I don&rsquo;t have much time to work on stuff myself I&rsquo;m
very happy to mentor others working on improving diagnostics in Rust.</p>

<p>Only recently did I realize <em>why</em> I care about them so much &ndash; they cater exactly to my approach
to learning programming languages! If I&rsquo;m not going to read the docs when I get started and try the
reactive approach, having help from the compiler is invaluable.</p>

<p>I think this space is relatively unexplored. Elm might have the best diagnostics out there,
and as diagnostics (helping all users of a language &ndash; new and experienced), they&rsquo;re great,
but as a teaching tool for newcomers; they still have a long way to go. Of course, compilers
like Rust are even further behind.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to experiment with is a first-class tool for reactive teaching. In a sense,
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">clippy</a> is already something like this. Clippy looks out for antipatterns, and tries to help
teach. But it also does many other things, and not all are teaching moments are antipatterns.</p>

<p>For example, in C, this isn&rsquo;t necessarily an antipattern:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">thingy</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">do_the_thing</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">frob</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Many C codebases use <code>if (foo = bar())</code>. It is a potential footgun if you confuse it with <code>==</code>,
but there&rsquo;s no way to be sure. Many compilers now have a warning for this that you can silence by
doubling the parentheses, though.</p>

<p>In Rust, this isn&rsquo;t an antipattern either:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// num is still 0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For someone new to Rust, they may feel that the way to have a function mutate arguments (like <code>num</code>) passed to it
is to use something like <code>mut x: u8</code>. What this actually does is copies <code>num</code> (because <code>u8</code> is a <code>Copy</code> type),
and allows you to mutate the copy within the scope of the function. The right way to make a function that
mutates arguments passed to it by-reference would be to do something like <code>fn add_one(x: &amp;mut u8)</code>.
If you try the <code>mut x</code> thing for non-Copy values, you&rsquo;d get a &ldquo;reading out of moved value&rdquo; error
when you try to access <code>num</code> after calling <code>add_one</code>. This would help you figure out what you did wrong,
and potentially that error could detect this situation and provide more specific help.</p>

<p>But for <code>Copy</code> types, this will just compile. And it&rsquo;s not an antipattern &ndash; the way this works
makes complete sense in the context of how Rust variables work, and is something that you do need
to use at times.</p>

<p>So we can&rsquo;t even warn on this. Perhaps in &ldquo;pedantic clippy&rdquo; mode, but really, it&rsquo;s not
a pattern we want to discourage. (At least in the C example that pattern is one
that many people prefer to forbid from their codebase)</p>

<p>But it would be nice if we could tell a learning programmer &ldquo;hey, btw, this is what this syntax
means, are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo;. With explanations and the ability to dismiss the error.</p>

<p>In fact, you don&rsquo;t even need to restrict this to potential footguns!</p>

<p>You can detect various things the learner is trying to do. Are they probably mixing up <code>String</code>
and <code>&amp;str</code>? Help them! Are they writing a trait? Give a little tooltip explaining the feature.</p>

<p>This is beginning to remind me of the original &ldquo;office assistant&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a>, which was super annoying.
But an opt-in tool or IDE feature which gives helpful suggestions could still be nice, especially
if you can strike a balance between being so dense it is annoying and so sparse it is useless.</p>

<p>It also reminds me of well-designed tutorial modes in games. Some games have a tutorial mode that guides you
through a set path of doing things. Other games, however, have a tutorial mode that will give you hints even
if you stray off the beaten path. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi">Michael</a> tells me that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey/">Prey</a> is
a recent example of such a game.</p>

<p>This really feels like it fits the &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; model I prefer. The student gets to mold their own
journey, but gets enough helpful hints and nudges from the &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; (the tool) so that they
don&rsquo;t end up wasting too much time and can make informed decisions on how to proceed learning.</p>

<p>Now, rust-clippy isn&rsquo;t exactly the place for this kind of tool. This tool needs the ability to globally
&ldquo;silence&rdquo; a hint once you&rsquo;ve learned it. rust-clippy is a linter, and while you can silence lints in
your code, you can&rsquo;t silence them globally for the current user. Nor does that really make sense.</p>

<p>But rust-clippy does have the infrastructure for writing stuff like this, so it&rsquo;s an ideal prototyping
point. I&rsquo;ve filed <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/issues/1737">this issue</a> to discuss this topic.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&rsquo;d love to see this as an IDE feature.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see more experimentation in the department of &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; teaching &mdash; not just tools like this.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The module and import system in Rust is sadly one of the many confusing things you have to deal with whilst
learning the language. A lot of these confusions stem from a misunderstanding of how it works.
In explaining this I&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s usually a common set of misunderstandings.</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/youre-doing-it-wrong/">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo;</a>, I want to try and explain one
&ldquo;right&rdquo; way of looking at it. You can go pretty far<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> without knowing this, but it&rsquo;s useful
and helps avoid confusion.</p>

<hr />

<p><br></p>

<p>First off, just to get this out of the way, <code>mod foo;</code> is basically a way of saying
&ldquo;look for <code>foo.rs</code> or <code>foo/mod.rs</code> and make a module named <code>foo</code> with its contents&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s the same as <code>mod foo { ... }</code> except the contents are in a different file. This
itself can be confusing at first, but it&rsquo;s not what I wish to focus on here. The Rust book explains this more
in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html#multiple-file-crates">the chapter on modules</a>.</p>

<p>In the examples here I will just be using <code>mod foo { ... }</code> since multi-file examples are annoying,
but keep in mind that the stuff here applies equally to multi-file crates.</p>

<h3>Motivating examples</h3>

<p>To start off, I&rsquo;m going to provide some examples of Rust code which compiles. Some of these may be
counterintuitive, based on your existing model.</p>

<p>These examples remind me of the &ldquo;point at infinity&rdquo; in elliptic curve crypto or fake particles in
physics or fake lattice elements in various fields of CS<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Sometimes, for something to make sense,
you add in things that don&rsquo;t normally exist. Similarly, these examples may contain code which
is not traditional Rust style, but the import system
still makes more sense when you include them.</p>

<h3>Imports</h3>

<p>The core confusion behind how imports work can really be resolved by remembering two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>use foo::bar::baz</code> resolves <code>foo</code> relative to the root module (<code>lib.rs</code> or <code>main.rs</code>)

<ul>
<li>You can resolve relative to the current module by explicily trying <code>use self::foo::bar::baz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>foo::bar::baz</code> within your code<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> resolves <code>foo</code> relative to the current module

<ul>
<li>You can resolve relative to the root by explicitly using <code>::foo::bar::baz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s actually &hellip; it. There are no further caveats. The rest of this is modelling what
constitutes as &ldquo;being within a module&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a pretty standard setup, where <code>extern crate</code> declarations are placed in the the root
module:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>        <span class="c1">// won&#39;t work</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="c1">// let ex = regex::Regex::new(&quot;&quot;);</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">ex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Regex</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When we say <code>extern crate regex</code>, we pull in the <code>regex</code> crate into the crate root. This behaves
pretty similar to <code>mod regex { /* contents of regex crate */}</code>. Basically, we&rsquo;ve imported
the crate into the crate root, and since all <code>use</code> paths are relative to the crate root,
<code>use regex::Regex</code> works fine inside the module.</p>

<p>Inline in code, <code>regex::Regex</code> won&rsquo;t work because as mentioned before inline paths are relative
to the current module. However, you can try <code>::regex::Regex::new("")</code>.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;ve imported <code>regex::Regex</code> in <code>mod foo</code>, that name is now accessible to everything inside
the module directly, so the code can just say <code>Regex::new()</code>.</p>

<p>The way you can view this is that <code>use blah</code> and <code>extern crate blah</code> create an item named
<code>blah</code> &ldquo;within the module&rdquo;, which is basically something like a symbolic link, saying
&ldquo;yes this item named <code>blah</code> is actually elsewhere but we&rsquo;ll pretend it&rsquo;s within the module&rdquo;</p>

<p>The error message from this code may further drive this home:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no function named <code>replace</code> in the module <code>foo</code>! But the compiler seems to think there is?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because <code>use std::mem::replace</code> basically is equivalent to there being something like:</p>

<p>except it&rsquo;s actually like a symlink to the function defined in <code>std::mem</code>. Because inline paths
are relative to the current module, saying <code>use std::mem::replace</code> works as if you had defined
a function <code>replace</code> in the same module, and you can refer to <code>replace()</code> without needing
any extra qualification in inline paths.</p>

<p>This also makes <code>pub use</code> fit perfectly in our model. <code>pub use</code> says &ldquo;make this symlink, but let
others see it too&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Folks often get annoyed when this doesn&rsquo;t work:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="kn">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kn">use</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// nope</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// use mem::replace;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As mentioned before, <code>use</code> paths are relative to the root module. There is no <code>mem</code>
in the root module, so this won&rsquo;t work. We can make it work via <code>self</code>, which I mentioned
before:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="kn">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kn">use</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// yep!</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kn">use</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Note that this brings overloading of the <code>self</code> keyword up to a grand total of <em>four</em>! Two cases
which occur in the import/path system:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>use self::foo</code> means &ldquo;find me <code>foo</code> within the current module&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>use foo::bar::{self, baz}</code> is equivalent to <code>use foo::bar; use foo::bar::baz;</code></li>
<li><code>fn foo(&amp;self)</code> lets you define methods and specify if the receiver is by-move, borrowed, mutably borrowed, or other</li>
<li><code>Self</code> within implementations lets you refer to the type being implemented on</li>
</ul>


<p>Oh well, at least it&rsquo;s not <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>Going back to one of the examples I gave at the beginning:</p>

<p>It should be clearer now why this works. The root module imports <code>mem</code>. Now, from everyone&rsquo;s point
of view, there&rsquo;s an item called <code>mem</code> in the root.</p>

<p>Within <code>mod foo</code>, <code>use mem::transmute</code> works because <code>use</code> is relative to the root, and <code>mem</code>
already exists in the root! When you <code>use</code> something, all child modules will see it as if it were
actually belonging to the module. (Non-child modules won&rsquo;t see it because of privacy, we
saw an example of this already)</p>

<p>This is why <code>use foo::transmute</code> works from <code>mod bar</code>, too. <code>bar</code> can refer to the contents
of <code>foo</code> via <code>use foo::whatever</code>, since <code>foo</code> is a child of the root module, and <code>use</code> is relative
to the root. <code>foo</code> already has an item named <code>transmute</code> inside it because it imported one.
Nothing in the parent module is private from the child, so we can <code>use foo::transmute</code> from
<code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>Generally, the standard way of doing things is to either not use modules (just a single lib.rs),
or, if you do use modules, put nothing other than <code>extern crate</code>s and <code>mod</code>s in the root.
This is why we rarely see shenanigans like the above; there&rsquo;s nothing in the root crate
to import, aside from other crates specified by <code>extern crate</code>. The trick of
&ldquo;reimport something from the parent module&rdquo; is also pretty rare because there&rsquo;s basically no
point to using that (just import it directly!). So this is not the kind of code
you&rsquo;ll see in the wild.</p>

<hr />

<p><br></p>

<p>Basically, the way the import system works can be summed up as:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>extern crate</code> and <code>use</code> will act as if they were defining the imported item in the current module, like a symbolic link</li>
<li><code>use foo::bar::baz</code> resolves the path relative to the root module</li>
<li><code>foo::bar::baz</code> in an inline path (i.e. not in a <code>use</code>) will resolve relative to the current module</li>
<li><code>::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the root module</li>
<li><code>self::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the current module</li>
<li><code>super::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the parent module</li>
</ul>


<p>Alright, on to the other half of this. Privacy.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>So how does privacy work?</p>

<p>Privacy, too, follows some basic rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you can access a module, you can access all of its <code>pub</code> contents</li>
<li>A module can always access its child modules, but not recursively

<ul>
<li>This means that a module cannot access private items in its children, nor can it access private grandchildren modules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A child can always access its parent modules (and their parents), and <em>all</em> their contents</li>
<li><code>pub(restricted)</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1422-pub-restricted.md">is a proposal</a> which extends this a bit, but it&rsquo;s experimental so we won&rsquo;t deal with it here</li>
</ul>

<p>We are able to write the path <code>foo::bar::baz::bazfunc</code> even though <code>bar</code> is private!</p>

<p>This is because we still have <em>access</em> to the module <code>bar</code>, by being a descendent module.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is helpful to some of you. I&rsquo;m not really sure how this can fit into the official
docs, but if you have ideas, feel free to adapt it<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>!</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This is because most of these misunderstandings lead to a model where you think fewer things compile, which is fine as long as it isn&rsquo;t too restrictive. Having a mental model where you feel more things will compile than actually do is what leads to frustration; the opposite can just be restrictive.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>One example closer to home is how Rust does lifetime resolution. Lifetimes form a lattice with <code>'static</code> being the bottom element. There is no top element for lifetimes in Rust syntax, but internally <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/rustc/ty/enum.Region.html#variant.ReEmpty">there is the &ldquo;empty lifetime&rdquo;</a> which is used during borrow checking. If something resolves to have an empty lifetime, it can&rsquo;t exist, so we get a lifetime error.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>When I say &ldquo;within your code&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;anywhere but a <code>use</code> statement&rdquo;. I may also term these as &ldquo;inline paths&rdquo;.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>My little student must think it queer<br>

Between the words and the intent<br>
He wonders what the poem meant<br></p>

<p>He gives his head a little shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what the author said!&rdquo;<br>
Providing another view instead<br></p>

<p>Seriously though, try reading <em>The Road Not Taken</em> as metacircular commentary on how the poem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#Analysis">is very often &ldquo;mis&#8221;interpreted</a>, and the nature of interpretation / <em>Death of the Author</em>. It fits perfectly when
you read &ldquo;road&rdquo; as &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;.</p>

<p><small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m only going to be changing the contents of <code>main()</code> here.</p>

we have a reference to the <code>Foo</code>, and in another case an owned copy.</p>

<p>We want to set a variable to these, but of course we can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re different types.</p>

<p>In one case, we have an owned <code>Foo</code>, and we can usually obtain a borrow from an owned type. For

<p>The problem is, <code>thing.get_owned()</code> returns an owned value. There&rsquo;s nothing that it gets anchored to
(we don&rsquo;t set its value to a variable), so it is just a temporary &ndash; we can call methods on it, but
once we&rsquo;re done the value will go out of scope.</p>

<p>What we want is something like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_owned</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">owned</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>but this will still give a borrow error &ndash; <code>owned</code> will still go out of scope within the <code>if</code> block,
and we need the reference to it last as long as <code>maybe_foo</code> (outside the block) is supposed to last.</p>

<p>So this is no good.</p>

<p>An alternate solution here <em>can</em> be copying/cloning the <code>Foo</code> in the <em>first</em> case by calling <code>.map(|x|
x.clone())</code> or <code>.cloned()</code> or something. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to clone, so this isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Another solution here &ndash; the generic advice for dealing with values which may be owned or borrow &ndash;
is to use <code>Cow</code>. It does incur a runtime check, though; one which can be optimized out if things are
inlined enough.</p>

<p>What we need to do here is to extend the lifetime of the temporary returned by <code>thing.get_owned()</code>.
We need to extend it <em>past</em> the scope of the <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to have an <code>Option</code> outside that scope which we mutate (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=7868045f2cebec6d23e7a065f5823767&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>).</p>

<p>This works in this case, but in this case we already had an <code>Option</code>. If <code>get_ref()</code> and <code>get_owned()</code>
returned <code>&amp;Foo</code> and <code>Foo</code> respectively, then we&rsquo;d need to do something like:</p>

<p>which is icky since it introduces an unwrap.</p>

<p>What we really need is a way to signal to the compiler that it needs to hold on to that temporary
for the scope of the enclosing block.</p>

<p>We can do that! (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1ddf2a428e73b01baa72acdad7cbbf2b&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>)</p>

<p>We know that Rust doesn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo; variables. If you want to name a variable, you have to
initialize it. <code>let foo;</code> feels rather like magic in this context, because it looks like we&rsquo;ve declared
an uninitialized variable.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s less well known is that Rust <em>can</em> do &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; initialization. Here, you declare a variable
and can initialize it later, but expressions involving the variable can only exist in branches
where the compiler knows it has been initialized.</p>

<p>This is the case here. We declared the <code>owned</code> variable beforehand. It now lives in the outer scope
and won&rsquo;t be destroyed until the end of the outer scope. However, the variable cannot be used directly
in an expression in the first branch, or after the <code>if</code>. Doing so will give a compile time error
saying <code>use of possibly uninitialized variable: `owned`</code>. We can only use it in the <code>else</code> branch
because the compiler can see that it is unconditionally initialized in that branch.</p>

<p>We can still read the value of <code>owned</code> indirectly through <code>maybe_foo</code> from outside the branch.
This is okay because the storage of <code>owned</code> is guaranteed to live as long as the outer scope,
and <code>maybe_foo</code> borrows from it. The only time <code>maybe_foo</code> is set to a value inside <code>owned</code> is when
<code>owned</code> has been initialized, so it is safe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo;</p>

<p>A common refrain in issue trackers and discussion forums everywhere. In isolation,
it&rsquo;s a variant of RTFM &ndash; give a non-answer when someone wants help, and bounce them
back to a manual or docs which they probably have already read. Not very helpful,
and not useful to anyone. Of course, one can accompany it with a nice explanation
of how to do it right; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing :)</p>

<p>Especially when it comes to programming languages, but in general in the context of any programming
tool or library, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; is almost always due to a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental model. The person, whilst
learning, has built a mental model of how the tool works, but this doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect
reality. Other times, it does reflect reality, but it does not reflect the mental model of the
maintainers (there can be multiple valid ways of looking at something!),
which leads to an impedance mismatch when reading docs or error messages.</p>

<p>In other cases, &ldquo;doing it wrong&rdquo; is a <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/178438">case of the XY problem</a>, where the user has problem X,
and think they can solve it with solution Y, and end up asking how they can achieve Y. This happens pretty
often &mdash; folks may be approaching your technology with prior experience with related things
that work differently, and may think the same idioms apply.</p>

<p>When I was at <a href="https://maintainerati.org/">WONTFIX</a>, someone who had done support work in the past mentioned that one
thing everyone learns in support is <strong>&ldquo;the user is always wrong &hellip;. and it&rsquo;s not their fault!&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good template for an attitude to approach &ldquo;doing it wrong&rdquo; questions about your
technology on online forums as well. And this doesn&rsquo;t just benefit the users who ask questions,
this attitude can benefit your technology!</p>

<p>Back when I used to be more active contributing to the Rust compiler, I also used to hang out in
<code>#rust</code> a lot, and often answer newbie questions (now <code>#rust-beginners</code> exists too, and I hang out
in both, but I don&rsquo;t really actively participate as much). One thing I learned to do was probe
deeper into why people hit that confusion in the first place. It&rsquo;s almost always a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental
model. Rust is rarely the first programming language folks learn, and people approach it with
preconceptions about how programming works. This isn&rsquo;t unique to Rust, this happens any time someone
learns a language with a different paradigm &mdash; learning C or C++ after doing a GCd language,
learning a functional language after an imperative one, statically typed after dynamic, or one of
the many other axes by which programming languages differ.</p>

<p>Other times, it&rsquo;s just assumptions they made when reading between the lines of whatever resource
they used to learn the language.</p>

<p>So, anyway, folks often have a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental model. If we are able to identify that model and correct
it, we have saved that person from potentially getting confused at every step in the future. Great!</p>

<p>With a <em>tiny</em> bit more effort, however, we can do one step better. Not for that person, but for
ourselves! We can probe a bit more and try to understand what caused them to obtain that mental
model. And fix the docs so that it never happens again! Of course, not everyone reads the docs, but
that&rsquo;s what diagnostics are for (in the case of errors). They&rsquo;re a tool to help us nudge the user
towards the right mental model, whilst helping them fix their immediate problem. Rust has for a long
time had pretty great diagnostics, with improvements happening all the time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I think this is at
least in part due to the attitude of the folks in <code>#rust</code>; always trying to figure out how to
preempt various confusions they see.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good attitude to have. I hope more folks, both in and out of the Rust community, approach
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; cases like that.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<p>Diagnostics issues are often the easiest way to contribute to the compiler itself, so if you want to contribute, I suggest starting there. Willing to mentor!<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine never hearing the phrase &lsquo;INHTPAMA&rsquo; again.</p>

<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s already the case? Bummer.</p>

<p>Often, when talking about Rust, folks refer to the core aliasing rule as &ldquo;that <code>&amp;mut</code> thing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;compile-time <code>RWLock</code>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;compile-time <code>RefCell</code>&rdquo;), or something similar. Basically, referring to
the fact that you can&rsquo;t mutate the data that is currently held via an <code>&amp;</code> reference, and that you
can&rsquo;t mutate or read the data currently held via an <code>&amp;mut</code> reference except through that reference
itself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always bugged me that we really don&rsquo;t have a name for this thing. It&rsquo;s one of the core
bits of Rust, and crops up often in discussions.</p>

<p>But we did have a name for it! It was &ldquo;INHTPAMA&rdquo; (which was later butchered into &ldquo;INHTWAMA&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This is a reference to <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/11/18/imagine-never-hearing-the-phrase-aliasable/">Niko&rsquo;s 2012 blog post</a>, titled
&ldquo;Imagine Never Hearing The Phrase &lsquo;aliasable, mutable&rsquo; again&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s where the aliasing
rules came from. Go read it, it&rsquo;s great. It talks about this weird language with at symbols
and purity, but I assure you, that language is Baby Rust. Or maybe Teenage Rust. The
<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/images/docs/9910_10104/Pg-lifecycle.jpg">lifecycle of rusts is complex and interesting</a> and I don&rsquo;t know how to categorize it.</p>

<p>The point of this post isn&rsquo;t really to encourage reviving the use of &ldquo;INHTWAMA&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s
a rather weird acronym that will probably confuse folks. I would like to have a better
way of refering to &ldquo;that <code>&amp;mut</code> thing&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;d prefer if it wasn&rsquo;t a confusing acronym
that carries no meaning of its own if you don&rsquo;t know the history of it. That&rsquo;s a recipe for
making new community members feel like outsiders.</p>

<p>But that post is amazing and I&rsquo;d hate to see it drop out of the collective
memory of the Rust community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about physics for a while. When I started this blog the intention was to
write about a wide variety of interests, but I ended up focusing on programming, despite the fact
that I was doing more physics than programming for most of the lifetime of this blog. Time to change
that, and hopefully write about other non-programming topics too.</em></p>

<p>Quantum Computing. It&rsquo;s the new hip thing that&rsquo;s going to change the world<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Someday.</p>

<p>In it&rsquo;s essence, where classical computing deals with &ldquo;bits&rdquo;, which are on/off states, quantum
computing deals with &ldquo;qubits&rdquo;, which are probabalistic quantum states that are often a mixture of on
and off. These have interesting properties which make certain kinds of so-far-hard computation very
easy to perform.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is not to teach quantum computing, rather to garner interest. I come to praise
quantum computing, not bury it<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. As a result, this post doesn&rsquo;t require a background in physics.
Having worked with very simple logic circuits is probably enough, though you may not even need that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m basically going to sketch out an example of a very simple quantum algorithm. One that&rsquo;s very
logic-defying. It&rsquo;s even logic-defying for many who have studied quantum mechanics; it certainly
was for me. When I learned this first I could understand <em>why</em> it worked but there was a lot of
dissonance between that and my intuitive conviction that it was <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<h2>The algorithm</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/deutsch/deutsch-jozsa.png" width="600" ></p>

<p>This is a quantum circuit (specifically, the circuit for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>).
It&rsquo;s used to find out the nature of a black-box function <code>f(x)</code>, which takes in one qubit and outputs
another<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. For now, you can try to interpret this circuit as if it were a regular logic circuit.
You&rsquo;ll soon see that this interpretation is wrong, but it&rsquo;s useful for the purposes of this explanation.</p>

<p>To run this algorithm, you first construct an &ldquo;oracle&rdquo; out of the black-box function. The oracle,
given inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, has outputs <code>x</code> and <code>y ⊕ f(x)</code> (where <code>⊕</code> is the symbol for XOR, the
&ldquo;exclusive OR&rdquo;).</p>

<p>As with logic circuits, data flow here goes from left to right. This circuit has two constant
inputs, a zero and a one. This is similar to how we might have constant &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; inputs
to logic circuits.</p>

<p>They are then passed through &ldquo;Hadamard gates&rdquo;. These are <em>like</em> NOT gates, in that applying them
twice is a no-op (they are their own inverse), but they&rsquo;re not actually NOT gates. I like to
describe them as &ldquo;sideways NOT gates&rdquo; since that description somewhat intuitively captures what&rsquo;s
going on with the qubits. What&rsquo;s important to note here is that they have one input and one
output, so they&rsquo;re unaffected by the goings-on in a different wire.</p>

<p>Once these inputs have been Hadamard&#8217;ed, they are fed to the oracle we constructed. The top input
goes on to become the top output. It&rsquo;s also passed through <code>f(x)</code> and XORd with the bottom input to make
the bottom output.</p>

<p>The top output is then Hadamard&#8217;ed again, and finally we observe its value.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where the magic comes in. By observing the top output, <em>we will know the nature of <code>f(x)</code></em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Wait, what? The top output doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any interaction with <code>f(x)</code> at all! How can that work?</p>

<p>In fact, we could try to rewrite this circuit such that the measured output definitely has no interaction with
<code>f(x)</code> whatever, assuming that the Hadamard gate isn&rsquo;t doing anything funky<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> (it isn&rsquo;t):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/deutsch/deutsch-jozsa-wrong.png" width="600" ></p>

<p>How in the world does this work?</p>

<h2>Why it works</h2>

<p>Sadly, I can&rsquo;t give a satisfying explanation to <em>exactly</em> why this works. This requires some quantum mechanics
background<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> to grasp.</p>

<p>However, I can give a hopefully-satisfying explanation as to why our regular intuition doesn&rsquo;t work here.</p>

<p>First and foremost: The rewritten circuit I showed above? It&rsquo;s wrong. If this was a logic circuit, we could always do that,
but in quantum computing, T-junctions like the following can&rsquo;t exist:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/deutsch/deutsch-jozsa-tjunction.png" width="600" ></p>

<p>This is due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem">&ldquo;No Cloning theorem&rdquo;</a>. Unlike regular logic circuits, you can&rsquo;t
just &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; a qubit. In some cases (like this one), you can try to create a similar qubit
via the same process (e.g. here we could take another 0 and pass it through a Hadamard gate), but
it&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;same&rdquo; qubit. Unlike bits, qubits have a stronger notion of unique identity.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s this sense of identity that fuels this algorithm (and most of quantum computing).</p>

<p>You see, while the top output of the oracle was <code>x</code>, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly the <em>same</em> <code>x</code>. This <code>x</code> had
been mixed with the lower output. This means that the upper and lower outputs are now <em>entangled</em>,
with their state depending on each other. In fact, it&rsquo;s really misleading to show the output as two
wires in the first place &ndash; it&rsquo;s really a single &ldquo;entangled&rdquo; state of two qubits that can&rsquo;t be
decomposed as a &ldquo;top half&rdquo; and a &ldquo;bottom half&rdquo;. Of course, this way of representing quantum circuits
is still used because it&rsquo;s a tidy way of visualizing these circuits, and physicists are aware of the
caveats involved.</p>

<p>So what happens is that when you observe the top output, you are really doing a partial observation
on the combined state of the two outputs, and this includes some information about <code>f(x)</code>, which
leaks out when you perform the observation.</p>

<p>These properties of qubits make quantum circuits work significantly differently from regular logic
ones. On one hand, this severely restricts what you can do with them, but at the same time, new
avenues of erstwhile-impossible operations open up. Most useful quantum algorithms (like Shor&rsquo;s
factorization algorithm) involve a mixture of a classical algorithm and a quantum circuit due to
this reason. It&rsquo;s pretty cool!</p>
