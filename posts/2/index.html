  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sum types are pretty cool. Just like how a struct is basically “This contains one of these <em>and</em> one of these”,
a sum type is “This contains one of these <em>or</em> one of these”.</p>

<p>So for example, the following sum type in Rust:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nf">Numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">u32</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or Swift:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="kt">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nf">stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nf">numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>would be one where it’s either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo::Stringy</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo::stringy</code> for swift), containing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>,
<em>or</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo::Numerical</code>, containing an integer.</p>

<p>This can be pretty useful. For example, messages between threads are often of a “this or that or that or that”
form.</p>

<p>The nice thing is, matching (switching) on these enums is usually <em>exhaustive</em> – you must list all
the cases (or include a default arm) for your code to compile. This leads to a useful component
of type safety – if you add a message to your message passing system, you’ll know where to update it.</p>

<p>Go doesn’t have these. Go <em>does</em> have interfaces, which are dynamically dispatched. The drawback here
is that you do not get the exhaustiveness condition, and consumers of your library can even add further
cases. (And, of course, dynamic dispatch can be slow). You <em>can</em> get exhaustiveness in Go with <a href="https://github.com/haya14busa/gosum">external tools</a>,
but it’s preferable to have such things in the language IMO.</p>

<p>Many years ago when I was learning Go I wrote a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2015/02/thoughts-of-rustacean-learning-go.html">blog post</a> about what I liked and disliked
as a Rustacean learning Go. Since then, I’ve spent a lot more time with Go, and I’ve learned to like each Go design decision that I initially
disliked, <em>except</em> for the lack of sum types. Most of my issues arose from “trying to program Rust in Go”,
i.e. using idioms that are natural to Rust (or other languages I’d used previously). Once I got used to the
programming style, I realized that aside from the lack of sum types I really didn’t find much missing
from the language. Perhaps improvements to error handling.</p>

<p>Now, my intention here isn’t really to sell sum types. They’re somewhat controversial for Go, and
there are good arguments on both sides. You can see one discussion on this topic <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19412">here</a>.
If I were to make a more concrete proposal I’d probably try to motivate this in much more depth. But even
I’m not very <em>strongly</em> of the opinion that Go needs sum types; I have a slight preference for it.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to try and sketch this proposal for sum types that has been floating around my
mind for a while. I end up mentioning it often and it’s nice to have something to link to. Overall,
I think this “fits well” with the existing Go language design.</p>

<h2 id="the-proposal">The proposal</h2>

<p>The essence is pretty straightforward: Extend interfaces to allow for “closed interfaces”. These are
interfaces that are only implemented for a small list of types.</p>

<p>Writing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> sum type above would be:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="k">interface</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">SomeFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">OtherFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t even need to have functions defined on it.</p>

<p>The interface functions can only be called if you have an interface object; they are not directly available
on variant types without explicitly casting (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo("...").SomeFunction()</code>).</p>

<p>(I’m not strongly for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> keyword syntax, it’s just a suggestion. The core idea is that
you define an interface and you define the types it closes over. Somehow.)</p>

<p>A better example would be an interface for a message-passing system for Raft:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">VoteRequest</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">CandidateId</span> <span class="kt">uint</span>
    <span class="n">Term</span> <span class="kt">uint</span>
    <span class="c">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">VoteResponse</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Term</span> <span class="kt">uint</span>
    <span class="n">VoteGranted</span> <span class="kt">bool</span>
    <span class="n">VoterId</span> <span class="kt">uint</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">AppendRequest</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">//...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">AppendResponse</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">//...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">// ...</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">RaftMessage</span> <span class="k">interface</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">VoteRequest</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">VoteResponse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">AppendRequest</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">AppendResponse</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, you use type switches for dealing with these:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">switch</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">msg</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">VoteRequest</span><span class="o">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Term</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Term</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="n">me</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reject_vote</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CandidateId</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="n">me</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">accept_vote</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CandidateId</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Term</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">VoteResponse</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="c">// ...</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">AppendRequest</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="c">// ...</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">AppendResponse</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="c">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is no need for the default case, unless you wish to leave one or more of the cases out.</p>

<p>Ideally, these could be implemented as inline structs instead of using dynamic dispatch. I’m not sure
what this entails for the GC design, but I’d love to hear thoughts on this.</p>

<p>We also make it possible to add methods to closed interfaces. This is in the spirit of
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16254">this proposal</a>, where you allow</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span> <span class="n">RaftMessage</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">me</span> <span class="n">Me</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kt">error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">// message handling logic</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>for closed interfaces.</p>

<p>This aligns more with how sum types are written and used in other languages; instead of assuming
that each method will be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch</code> on the variant, you can write arbitrary code that <em>may</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch</code>
on the type but it can also just call other methods. This is really nice because you can write
methods in <em>both</em> ways – if it’s a “responsibility of the inner type” kind of method, require it in
the interface and delegate it to the individual types. If it’s a “responsibility of the interface”
method, write it as a method on the interface as a whole. I kind of wish Rust had this, because in Rust
you sometimes end up writing things like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nn">Foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">Stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="nf">.process</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="nn">Foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">Numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="nf">.process</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="c">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yes, this would work better as a trait, but then you lose some niceties of Rust enums. With this
proposal Go can have it both ways.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, thoughts? This is a really rough proposal, and I’m not sure how receptive other Gophers will be
to this, nor how complex its implementation would be. I don’t really intend to submit this as a formal proposal,
but if someone else wants to they are more than welcome to build on this idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Rust community lately has been focusing a lot on “async I/O” through the <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/">tokio</a>
project. This is pretty great!</p>

<p>But for many in the community who haven’t worked with web servers and related things it’s pretty
confusing as to what we’re trying to achieve there. When this stuff was being discussed around 1.0,
I was pretty lost as well, having never worked with this stuff before.</p>

<p>What’s all this Async I/O business about? What are coroutines? Lightweight threads? Futures? How
does this all fit together?</p>

<h2 id="what-problem-are-we-trying-to-solve">What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>

<p>One of Rust’s key features is “fearless concurrency”. But the kind of concurrency required for handling a
large amount of I/O bound tasks – the kind of concurrency found in Go, Elixir, Erlang – is absent
from Rust.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to build something like a web service. It’s going to be handling thousands of
requests at any point in time (known as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">c10k</a> problem”). In general, the problem we’re
considering is having a huge number of I/O bound (usually network I/O) tasks.</p>

<p>“Handling N things at once” is best done by using threads. But … <em>thousands</em> of threads? That
sounds a bit much. Threads can be pretty expensive: Each thread needs to allocate a large stack,
setting up a thread involves a bunch of syscalls, and context switching is expensive.</p>

<p>Of course, thousands of threads <em>all doing work</em> at once is not going to work anyway. You only
have a fixed number of cores, and at any one time only one thread will be running on a core.</p>

<p>But for cases like web servers, most of these threads won’t be doing work. They’ll be waiting on the
network. Most of these threads will either be listening for a request, or waiting for their response
to get sent.</p>

<p>With regular threads, when you perform a blocking I/O operation, the syscall returns control
to the kernel, which won’t yield control back, because the I/O operation is probably not finished.
Instead, it will use this as an opportunity to swap in a different thread, and will swap the original
thread back when its I/O operation is finished (i.e. it’s “unblocked”). Without Tokio and friends,
this is how you would handle such things in Rust. Spawn a million threads; let the OS deal with
scheduling based on I/O.</p>

<p>But, as we already discovered, threads don’t scale well for things like this<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We need “lighter” threads.</p>

<h2 id="lightweight-threading">Lightweight threading</h2>

<p>I think the best way to understand lightweight threading is to forget about Rust for a moment
and look at a language that does this well, Go.</p>

<p>Instead of using OS threads, Go has lightweight threads, called “goroutines”. You spawn these with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go</code>
keyword. A web server might do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">listener</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">err</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">net</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c">// handle err</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">err</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">listener</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Accept</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="c">// handle err</span>

    <span class="c">// spawn goroutine:</span>
    <span class="k">go</span> <span class="n">handler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a loop which waits for new TCP connections, and spawns a goroutine with the connection
and the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handler</code>. Each connection will be a new goroutine, and the goroutine will shut down
when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handler</code> finishes. In the meantime, the main loop continues executing, because it’s running in
a different goroutine.</p>

<p>So if these aren’t “real” (operating system) threads, what’s going on?</p>

<p>A goroutine is an example of a “lightweight” thread. The operating system doesn’t know about these,
it sees N threads owned by the Go runtime, and the Go runtime maps M goroutines onto them<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, swapping
goroutines in and out much like the operating system scheduler. It’s able to do this because
Go code is already interruptible for the GC to be able to run, so the scheduler can always ask goroutines
to stop. The scheduler is also aware of I/O, so when a goroutine is waiting on I/O it yields to the scheduler.</p>

<p>Essentialy, a compiled Go function will have a bunch of points scattered throughout it where it
tells the scheduler and GC “take over if you want” (and also “I’m waiting on stuff, please take
over”).</p>

<p>When a goroutine is swapped on an OS thread, some registers will be saved, and
the program counter will switch to the new goroutine.</p>

<p>But what about its stack? OS threads have a large stack with them, and you kinda need a stack for functions
and stuff to work.</p>

<p>What Go used to do was segmented stacks. The reason a thread needs a large stack is that most
programming languages, including C, expect the stack to be contiguous, and stacks can’t just be
“reallocated” like we do with growable buffers since we expect stack data to stay put so that
pointers to stack data to continue to work. So we reserve all the stack we think we’ll ever need
(~8MB), and hope we don’t need more.</p>

<p>But the expectation of stacks being contiguous isn’t strictly necessary. In Go, stacks are made of tiny
chunks. When a function is called, it checks if there’s enough space on the stack for it to run, and if not,
allocates a new chunk of stack and runs on it. So if you have thousands of threads doing a small amount of work,
they’ll all get thousands of tiny stacks and it will be fine.</p>

<p>These days, Go actually does something different; it <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-stacks-are-handled-in-go/">copies stacks</a>. I mentioned that stacks can’t
just be “reallocated” we expect stack data to stay put. But that’s not necessarily true —
because Go has a GC it knows what all the pointers are <em>anyway</em>, and it can rewrite pointers to
stack data on demand.</p>

<p>Either way, Go’s rich runtime lets it handle this stuff well. Goroutines are super cheap, and you can spawn
thousands without your computer having problems.</p>

<p>Rust <em>used</em> to support lightweight/”green” threads (I believe it used segmented stacks). However, Rust cares
a lot about not paying for things you don’t use, and this imposes a penalty on all your code even if you
aren’t using green threads, and it was removed pre-1.0.</p>

<h2 id="async-io">Async I/O</h2>

<p>A core building block of this is Async I/O. As mentioned in the previous section,
with regular blocking I/O, the moment you request I/O your thread will not be allowed to run
(“blocked”) until the operation is done. This is perfect when working with OS threads (the OS
scheduler does all the work for you!), but if you have lightweight threads you instead want to
replace the lightweight thread running on the OS thread with a different one.</p>

<p>Instead, you use non-blocking I/O, where the thread queues a request for I/O with the OS and continues
execution. The I/O request is executed at some later point by the kernel. The thread then needs to ask the
OS “Is this I/O request ready yet?” before looking at the result of the I/O.</p>

<p>Of course, repeatedly asking the OS if it’s done can be tedious and consume resources. This is why
there are system calls like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">epoll</code></a>. Here, you can bundle together a bunch of unfinished I/O requests,
and then ask the OS to wake up your thread when <em>any</em> of these completes. So you can have a scheduler
thread (a real thread) that swaps out lightweight threads that are waiting on I/O, and when there’s nothing
else happening it can itself go to sleep with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">epoll</code> call until the OS wakes it up (when one of the I/O
requests completes).</p>

<p>(The exact mechanism involved here is probably more complex)</p>

<p>So, bringing this to Rust, Rust has the <a href="https://github.com/carllerche/mio">mio</a> library, which is a platform-agnostic
wrapper around non-blocking I/O and tools like epoll/kqueue/etc. It’s a building block; and while
those used to directly using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">epoll</code> in C may find it helpful, it doesn’t provide a nice programming
model like Go does. But we can get there.</p>

<h2 id="futures">Futures</h2>

<p>These are another building block. A <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.17/futures/future/trait.Future.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future</code></a> is the promise of eventually having a value
(in fact, in Javascript these are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Promise</code>s).</p>

<p>So for example, you can ask to listen on a network socket, and get a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future</code> back  (actually, a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stream</code>, which is like a future but for a sequence of values). This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future</code> won’t contain the
response <em>yet</em>, but will know when it’s ready. You can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wait()</code> on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future</code>, which will block
until you have a result, and you can also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll()</code> it, asking it if it’s done yet (it will give you
the result if it is).</p>

<p>Futures can also be chained, so you can do stuff like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">future.then(|result| process(result))</code>.
The closure passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">then</code> itself can produce another future, so you can chain together
things like I/O operations. With chained futures, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll()</code> is how you make progress; each time
you call it it will move on to the next future provided the existing one is ready.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good abstraction over things like non-blocking I/O.</p>

<p>Chaining futures works much like chaining iterators. Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and_then</code> (or whatever combinator)
call returns a struct wrapping around the inner future, which may contain an additional closure.
Closures themselves carry their references and data with them, so this really ends up being
very similar to a tiny stack!</p>

<h2 id="-tokio-">🗼 Tokio 🗼</h2>

<p>Tokio’s essentially a nice wrapper around mio that uses futures. Tokio has a core
event loop, and you feed it closures that return futures. What it will do is
run all the closures you feed it, use mio to efficiently figure out which futures
are ready to make a step<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, and make progress on them (by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll()</code>).</p>

<p>This actually is already pretty similar to what Go was doing, at a conceptual level.
You have to manually set up the Tokio event loop (the “scheduler”), but once you do
you can feed it tasks which intermittently do I/O, and the event loop takes
care of swapping over to a new task when one is blocked on I/O. A crucial difference is
that Tokio is single threaded, whereas the Go scheduler can use multiple OS threads
for execution. However, you can offload CPU-critical tasks onto other OS threads and
use channels to coordinate so this isn’t that big a deal.</p>

<p>While at a conceptual level this is beginning to shape up to be similar to what we had for Go, code-wise this doesn’t look so pretty. For the following Go code:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// error handling ignored for simplicity</span>

<span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">ReturnType</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">doIo</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">someFinalResult</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Rust code will look something like</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// error handling ignored for simplicity</span>

<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Future</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ReturnType</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ErrorType</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">do_io</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="nf">.and_then</span><span class="p">(|</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">|</span> <span class="nf">do_more_io</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">compute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)))</span>
          <span class="nf">.and_then</span><span class="p">(|</span><span class="n">more_data</span><span class="p">|</span> <span class="nf">do_even_more_io</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">more_compute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">more_data</span><span class="p">)))</span>
    <span class="c">// ......</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not pretty. <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.25/futures/future/fn.loop_fn.html#examples">The code gets worse if you introduce branches and loops</a>. The problem is that in Go we
got the interruption points for free, but in Rust we have to encode this by chaining up combinators
into a kind of state machine. Ew.</p>

<h2 id="generators-and-asyncawait">Generators and async/await</h2>

<p>This is where generators (also called coroutines) come in.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html">Generators</a> are an experimental feature in Rust. Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">generator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">||</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">loop</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">yield</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
<span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">generator</span><span class="nf">.resume</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="nn">GeneratorState</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">Yielded</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">generator</span><span class="nf">.resume</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="nn">GeneratorState</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">Yielded</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">generator</span><span class="nf">.resume</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="nn">GeneratorState</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">Yielded</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Functions are things which execute a task and return once. On the other hand, generators
return multiple times; they pause execution to “yield” some data, and can be resumed
at which point they will run until the next yield. While my example doesn’t show this, generators
can also finish executing like regular functions.</p>

<p>Closures in Rust are
<a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/">sugar for a struct containing captured data, plus an implementation of one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn</code> traits to make it callable</a>.</p>

<p>Generators are similar, except they implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Generator</code> trait<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, and usually store an enum representing various states.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html#generators-as-state-machines">unstable book</a> has some examples on what the generator state machine enum will look like.</p>

<p>This is much closer to what we were looking for! Now our code can look like this:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Future</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ReturnType</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ErrorType</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="nf">futurify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">generator</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futurify</code> is a function that takes a generator and returns a future which on
each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll</code> call will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resume()</code> the generator, and return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NotReady</code> until the generator
finishes executing.</p>

<p>But wait, this is even <em>more</em> ugly! What was the point of converting our relatively
clean callback-chaining code into this mess?</p>

<p>Well, if you look at it, this code now looks <em>linear</em>. We’ve converted our callback
code to the same linear flow as the Go code, however it has this weird loop-yield boilerplate
and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futurify</code> function and is overall not very neat.</p>

<p>And that’s where <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await">futures-await</a> comes in. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futures-await</code> is a procedural macro that
does the last-mile work of packaging away this boilerplate. It essentially lets you write
the above function as</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[async]</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ReturnType</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ErrorType</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">do_io</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">compute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">more_data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">do_more_io</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="c">// ....</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice and clean. Almost as clean as the Go code, just that we have explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await!()</code> calls. These
await calls are basically providing the same function as the interruption points that Go code
gets implicitly.</p>

<p>And, of course, since it’s using a generator under the hood, you can loop and branch and do whatever
else you want as normal, and the code will still be clean.</p>

<h2 id="tying-it-together">Tying it together</h2>

<p>So, in Rust, futures can be chained together to provide a lightweight stack-like system. With async/await,
you can neatly write these future chains, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> provides explicit interruption points on each I/O operation.
Tokio provides an event loop “scheduler” abstraction, which you can feed async functions to, and under the hood it
uses mio to abstract over low level non-blocking I/O primitives.</p>

<p>These are components which can be used independently — you can use tokio with futures without
using async/await. You can use async/await without using Tokio. For example, I think this would be
useful for Servo’s networking stack. It doesn’t need to do <em>much</em> parallel I/O (not at the order
of thousands of threads), so it can just use multiplexed OS threads. However, we’d still want
to pool threads and pipeline data well, and async/await would help here.</p>

<p>Put together, all these components get something almost as clean as the Go stuff, with a little more
explicit boilerplate. Because generators (and thus async/await) play nice with the borrow checker
(they’re just enum state machines under the hood), Rust’s safety guarantees are all still in play,
and we get to have “fearless concurrency” for programs having a huge quantity of I/O bound tasks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week ago <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html">we put out a call for blog posts for what folks think Rust should do in 2018</a>.</p>

<p>This is mine.</p>

<h2 id="overall-focus">Overall focus</h2>

<p>I think 2017 was a great year for Rust. Near the beginning of the year, after custom derive
and a bunch of things stabilized, I had a strong feeling that Rust was “complete”. Not really “finished”,
there’s still tons of stuff to improve, but this was the first time stable Rust was the language
I wanted it to be, and was something I could recommend for most kinds of work without reservations.</p>

<p>I think this is a good signal to wind down the frightening pace of new features Rust has been getting.
And that happened! We had the impl period, which took some time to focus on <em>getting things done</em> before
proposing new things. And Rust is feeling more polished than ever.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-2018/">Nick</a>, I feel like 2018 should be boring. I feel like we should focus on polishing what
we have, implementing all the things, and improving our approachability as a language.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to see this as an extended impl period.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean I’m looking for a moratorium on RFCs, really. Hell, in the past few days I’ve posted
one pre-pre-RFC<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, one pre-RFC, and one RFC (from the pre-RFC). I’m mostly looking for <em>prioritizing</em> impl
work over designing new things, but still having <em>some</em> focus on design.</p>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>

<p>I think Rust still has some “missing bits” which make it hard to justify for some use cases. Rust’s
async story is being fleshed out. We don’t yet have stable SIMD or stable inline ASM. The microcontroller
story is kinda iffy. RLS/clippy need nightly. I’d like to see these crystallize and stabilize this year.</p>

<p>I think this year we need to continue to take a critical look at Rust’s ergonomics. Last year the
ergonomics initiative was really good for Rust, and I’d like to see more of that. This is kind of at
odds with my “focus on polishing Rust” statement, but fixing ergonomics is not just new features. It’s
also about figuring out barriers in Rust, polishing mental models, improving docs/diagnostics, and in
general figuring out how to best present Rust’s features. Starting dialogues about confusing bits of
the language and figuring out the best mental model to present them with is something we should
continue doing. Sometimes this may need new features, indeed, but not always. We must continue
to take a critical look at how our language presents itself to newcomers.</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>I’d like to see a stronger focus on mentoring. Mentoring on rustc, mentoring on major libraries, mentoring on
Rust tooling, mentoring everywhere. This includes not just the mentors, but the associated infrastructure –
contribution docs, sites like <a href="http://starters.servo.org/">servo-starters</a> and <a href="https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork">findwork</a>, and similar tooling.</p>

<p>I’m also hoping for more companies to invest back into Rust. This year <a href="http://buoyant.io/">Buoyant</a> became pretty well
known within the community, and many of their employees are paid to work on various important parts
of the Rust ecosystem. There are also multiple consulting groups that contribute to the ecosystem.
It’s nice to see that “paid to work on Rust” is no longer limited to Mozilla, and this is crucial
for the health of the language. I hope this trend continues.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to see more companies <em>talk</em> about Rust. Success stories are really nice to hear.
I’ve heard many amazing success stories this year, but a lot of them are things which can’t be shared.</p>

<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>

<p>Last year we started seeing the limits of the RFC process. Large RFCs were stressful for both the RFC authors
and participating community members, and rather opaque for newer community members wishing to participate.
Alternative models have been discussed; I’d like to see more movement on this front.</p>

<p>I’d also like to grow the moderation team; it is currently rather small and doesn’t have the capacity to handle
incidents in a timely fashion.</p>

<h2 id="docs--learning">Docs / Learning</h2>

<p>I’d like to see a focus on improving Rust for folks who learn the language by <em>trying things</em> over reading books <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This means better diagnostics, better alternative resources like rustbyexample, etc. Improving mentorship helps here
as well.</p>

<p>Of course, I’d like to see our normal docs work continue to happen.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m overall really excited for 2018. I think we’re doing great on most fronts so far, and if we
maintain the momentum we’ll have an even-more-awesome Rust by the end of this year!</p>

  <p>I think “undefined” and “unsafe” are considered to be synonyms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is … incorrect. However, we in the Rust community have never really explicitly outlined the
distinction, so that confusion is on us! This blog post is an attempt to clarify the difference of
terminology as used within the Rust community. It’s a very useful but subtle distinction and I feel we’d be
able to talk about safety more expressively if this was well known.</p>

<h2 id="unsafe-means-two-things-in-rust-yay">Unsafe means two things in Rust, yay</h2>

<p>So, first off, the waters are a bit muddied by the fact that Rust uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> to both mean “within
an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe {}</code> block” and “something Bad is happening here”. It’s possible to have safe code
within an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> block; indeed this is the <em>primary function</em> of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> block. Somewhat
counterintutively, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> block’s purpose is to actually tell the compiler “I know you don’t
like this code but trust me, it’s safe!” (where “safe” is the negation of the <em>second</em> meaning of “unsafe”,
i.e. “something Bad is not happening here”).</p>

<p>Similarly, we use “safe code” to mean “code not using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe{}</code> blocks” but also “code that is not unsafe”,
i.e. “code where nothing bad happens”.</p>

<p>This blog post is primarily about the “something bad is happening here” meaning of “unsafe”. When referring
to the other kind I’ll specifically say “code within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> blocks” or something like that.</p>

<h2 id="undefined-behavior">Undefined behavior</h2>

<p>In languages like C, C++, and Rust, undefined behavior is when you reach a point where
the compiler is allowed to do anything with your code. This is distinct from implementation-defined
behavior, where usually a given compiler/library will do a deterministic thing, however they have some
freedom from the spec in deciding what that thing is.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior can be pretty scary. This is usually because in practice it causes problems when
the compiler assumes “X won’t happen because it is undefined behavior”, and X ends up happening,
breaking the assumptions. In some cases this does nothing dangerous, but often the compiler will
end up doing wacky things to your code. Dereferencing a null pointer will <em>sometimes</em> cause segfaults
(which is the compiler generating code that actually dereferences the pointer, making the kernel
complain), but sometimes it will be optimized in a way that assumes it won’t and moves around code
such that you have major problems.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior is a global property, based on how your code is <em>used</em>. The following function
in C++ or Rust may or may not exhibit undefined behavior, based on how it gets used:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">deref</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// do not try this at home</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">deref</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="nb">u32</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">u32</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As long as you always call it with a valid pointer to an integer, there is no undefined behavior
involved.</p>

<p>But in either language, if you use it with some pointer conjured out of thin air (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x01</code>), that’s
probably undefined behavior.</p>

<p>As it stands, UB is a property of the entire program and its execution. Sometimes you may have snippets of code
that will always exhibit undefined behavior regardless of how they are called, but in general UB
is a global property.</p>

<h2 id="unsafe-behavior">Unsafe behavior</h2>

<p>Rust’s concept of “unsafe behavior” (I’m coining this term because “unsafety” and “unsafe code” can
be a bit confusing) is far more scoped. Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn deref</code> <em>is</em> “unsafe”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, even if you <em>always</em>
call it with a valid pointer. The reason it is still unsafe is because it’s possible to trigger UB by only
changing the “safe” caller code. I.e. “changes to code outside unsafe blocks can trigger UB if they include
calls to this function”.</p>

<p>Basically, in Rust a bit of code is “safe” if it cannot exhibit undefined behavior under all circumstances of
that code being used. The following code exhibits “safe behavior”:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">raw</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="nb">u32</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">raw</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We dereferenced a raw pointer, but we knew it was valid. Of course, actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> blocks will
usually be “actually totally safe” for less obvious reasons, and part of this is because
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/working-with-unsafe.html#working-with-unsafe"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> blocks sometimes can pollute the entire module</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, “safe” in Rust is a more local property. Code isn’t safe just because you only use it in
a way that doesn’t trigger UB, it is safe because there is literally <em>no way to use it such that it
will do so</em>. No way to do so without using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> blocks, that is<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a distinction that’s <em>possible</em> to draw in Rust because it gives us the ability
to compartmentalize safety. Trying to apply this definition to C++ is problematic; you can
ask “is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> safe?”, but you can <em>always</em> use it within code in a way that you trigger
undefined behavior, because C++ does not have the tools for compartmentalizing safety. The distinction
between “code which doesn’t need to worry about safety” and “code which does need to worry about safety”
exists in Rust in the form of “code outside of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe {}</code>” and “code within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe {}</code>”, whereas in
C++ it’s a lot fuzzier and based on expectations (and documentation/the spec).</p>

<p>So C++’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> is “safe” in the sense that it does what you expect but
if you use it in a way counter to how it’s <em>supposed</em> to be used (constructing one from an invalid pointer, for example)
it can blow up. This is still a useful sense of safety, and is how one regularly reasons about safety in C++. However it’s not
the same sense of the term as used in Rust, which can be a bit more formal about what the expectations
actually are.</p>

<p>So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> in Rust is a strictly more general concept – all code exhibiting undefined behavior in Rust is also “unsafe”,
however not all “unsafe” code in Rust exhibits undefined behavior as written in the current program.</p>

<p>Rust furthermore attempts to guarantee that you will not trigger undefined behavior if you do not use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe {}</code> blocks.
This of course depends on the correctness of the compiler (it has bugs) and of the libraries you use (they may also have bugs)
but this compartmentalization gets you most of the way there in having UB-free programs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-size"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code></a> is the worst.</p>

<p>It’s a CSS property probably everyone who writes CSS has used at some point. It’s pretty ubiquitous.</p>

<p>And it’s <em>super</em> complicated.</p>

<p>“But it’s just a number”, you say. “How can that be complicated?”</p>

<p>I too felt that way one time. And then I worked on implementing it for <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Stylo">stylo</a>.</p>

<p>Stylo is the project to integrate <a href="http://github.com/servo/servo/">Servo</a>’s styling system into Firefox. The styling system handles
parsing CSS, determining which rules apply to which elements, running this through the cascade,
and eventually computing and assigning styles to individual elements in the tree. This happens not
only on page load, but also whenever various kinds of events (including DOM manipulation) occur,
and is a nontrivial portion of pageload and interaction times.</p>

<p>Servo is in <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, and makes use of Rust’s safe parallelism in many places, one of them being
styling. Stylo has the potential to bring these speedups into Firefox, along with the added safety
of the code being in a safer systems language.</p>

<p>Anyway, as far as the styling system is concerned, I believe that font-size is the most complex
property it has to handle. Some properties may be more complicated when it comes to layout or
rendering, but font-size is probably the most complex one in the department of styling.</p>

<p>I’m hoping this post can give an idea of how complex the Web can <em>get</em>, and also serve as documentation
for some of these complexities. I’ll also try to give an idea of how the styling system works throughout this post.</p>

<p>Alright. Let’s see what is so complex about font-size.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>

<p>The syntax of the property is pretty straightforward. You can specify it as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A length (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12px</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">15pt</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">13em</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4in</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8rem</code>)</li>
  <li>A percentage (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50%</code>)</li>
  <li>A compound of the above, via a calc (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calc(12px + 4em + 20%)</code>)</li>
  <li>An absolute keyword (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">medium</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">small</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">large</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x-large</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>A relative keyword (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">larger</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smaller</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three are common amongst quite a few length-related properties. Nothing abnormal in the syntax.</p>

<p>The next two are interesting. Essentially, the absolute keywords map to various pixel values, and match
the result of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;font size=foo&gt;</code> (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size=3</code> is the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size: medium</code>). The <em>actual</em> value they map to
is not straightforward, and I’ll get to that later in this post.</p>

<p>The relative keywords basically scale the size up or down. The mechanism of the scaling was also complex, however
this has changed. I’ll get to that too.</p>

<h2 id="em-and-rem-units">em and rem units</h2>

<p>First up: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> units. One of the things you can specify in <em>any</em> length-based CSS property is a value with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rem</code>
unit.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5em</code> means “5 times the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> of the element this is applied to”. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5rem</code> means “5 times the font-size of the root element”</p>

<p>The implications of this are that font-size needs to be computed before all the other properties (well, not quite, but we’ll get to that!)
so that it is available during that time.</p>

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> units within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> itself. In this case, it computed relative to the font-size of the <em>parent</em> element, since
you can’t use the font-size of the element to compute itself. (This is identical to using a percentage unit)</p>

<h2 id="minimum-font-size">Minimum font size</h2>

<p>Browsers let you set a “minimum” font size in their preferences, and text will not be scaled below it. It’s useful for those with
trouble seeing small text.</p>

<p>However, this doesn’t affect properties which depend on font-size via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> units. So if you’re using a minimum font size,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div style="font-size: 1px; height: 1em; background-color: red"&gt;</code> will have a very tiny height (which you’ll notice from the color),
but the text will be clamped to the minimum size.</p>

<p>What this effectively means is that you need to keep track of <em>two</em> separate computed font size values. There’s one value that
is used to actually determine the font size used for the text, and one value that is used whenever the style system needs to
know the font-size (e.g. to compute an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> unit.)</p>

<p>This gets slightly more complicated when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character">ruby</a> is involved. In ideographic scripts (usually, Han
and Han-based scripts like Kanji or Hanja) it’s sometimes useful to have the pronunciation
of each character above it in a phonetic script, for the aid of readers without proficiency in that
script, and this is known as “ruby” (“furigana” in Japanese). Because these scripts are ideographic,
it’s not uncommon for learners to know the pronunciation of a word but have no idea how to write it.
An example would be <ruby><rb>日</rb><rt>に</rt><rb>本</rb><rt>ほん</rt></ruby>, which is 日本 (“nihon”,
i.e. “Japan”) in Kanji with ruby にほん in the phonetic Hiragana script above it.</p>

<p>As you can probably see, the phonetic ruby text is in a smaller font size (usually 50% of the font
size of the main text<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">1</a></sup>). The minimum font-size support <em>respects</em> this, and ensures that if the ruby
is supposed to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50%</code> of the size of the text, the minimum font size for the ruby is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50%</code> of the
original minimum font size. This avoids clamped text from looking like <ruby><rb>日</rb><rt style="font-size: 1em">に</rt><rb>本</rb><rt style="font-size: 1em">ほん</rt></ruby> (where both get set to
the same size), which is pretty ugly.</p>

<h2 id="text-zoom">Text zoom</h2>

<p>Firefox additionally lets you zoom text only when zooming. If you have trouble reading small things, it’s great to
be able to just blow up the text on the page without having the whole page get zoomed (which means you need to scroll
around a lot).</p>

<p>In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> units of other properties <em>do</em> get zoomed as well. After all, they’re supposed to be relative to the text’s font
size (and may have some relation to the text), so if that size has changed so should they.</p>

<p>(Of course, that argument could also apply to the min font size stuff. I don’t have an answer for why it doesn’t.)</p>

<p>This is actually pretty straightforward to implement. When computing absolute font sizes (including
keywords), zoom them if text zoom is on. For everything else continue as normal.</p>

<p>Text zoom is also disabled within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;svg:text&gt;</code> elements, which leads to some trickiness here.</p>

<h2 id="interlude-how-the-style-system-works">Interlude: How the style system works</h2>

<p>Before I go ahead it’s probably worth giving a quick overview of how everything works.</p>

<p>The responsibiltiy of a style system is to take in CSS code and a DOM tree, and assign computed styles to each element.</p>

<p>There’s a distinction between “specified” and “computed” here. “specified” styles are in the format
you specify in CSS, whereas computed styles are those that get attached to the elements, sent to
layout, and inherited from. A given specified style may compute to different values when applied to
different elements.</p>

<p>So while you can <em>specify</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width: 5em</code>, it will compute to something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width: 80px</code>. Computed values are usually a
cleaned up form of the specified value.</p>

<p>The style system will first parse the CSS, producing a bunch of rules usually containing declarations (a declaration is like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width: 20%;</code>; i.e. a property name and a specified value)</p>

<p>It then goes through the tree in top-down order (this is parallelized in Stylo), figuring out which declarations <em>apply</em> to each element
and in which order – some declarations have precedence over others. Then it will compute each relevant declaration against the element’s style (and parent style, among other bits of info),
and store this value in the element’s “computed style”.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of optimizations that Gecko and Servo do here to avoid duplicated work<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. There’s a
bloom filter for quickly checking if deep descendent selectors apply to a subtree. There’s a “rule
tree” that helps cache effort from determining applicable declarations. Computed styles are
reference counted and shared very often (since the default state is to inherit from the parent or
from the default style).</p>

<p>But ultimately, this is the gist of what happens.</p>

<h2 id="keyword-values">Keyword values</h2>

<p>Alright, this is where it gets complicated.</p>

<p>Remember when I said <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size: medium</code> was a thing that mapped to a value?</p>

<p>So what does it map to?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out, it depends on the font family. For the following HTML:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font: medium monospace"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font: medium sans-serif"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>you get (<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RZgxjw">codepen</a>)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font: medium monospace">text</span>
<span style="font: medium sans-serif">text</span>
</div>

<p>where the first one computes to a font-size of 13px, and the second one computes to a font-size of
16px. You can check this in the computed style pane of your devtools, or by using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getComputedStyle()</code>.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> the reason behind this is that monospace fonts tend to be wider, so the default font size (medium)
is scaled so that they have similar widths, and all other keyword font sizes get shifted as well. The final result is something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/font-size-table.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>Firefox and Servo have <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/d415617a5bbe65a73bd805808a7ac76f38a1861c/components/style/properties/longhand/font.mako.rs#L763-L774">a matrix</a> that helps derive the values for all the absolute
font-size keywords based on the “base size” (i.e. the computed of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size: medium</code>). Actually,
Firefox has <a href="http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c329d562fb6c6218bdb79290faaf015467ef89e2/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#3272-3341">three tables</a> to support some legacy use cases like quirks mode (Servo has
yet to add support for these tables). We query other parts of the browser for what the “base size”
is based on the language and font family.</p>

<p>Wait, but what does the language have to do with this anyway? How does the language impact font-size?</p>

<p>It turns out that the base size depends on the font family <em>and</em> the language, and you can configure this.</p>

<p>Both Firefox and Chrome (using an extension) actually let you tweak which fonts get used on a per-language basis,
<em>as well as the default (base) font-size</em>.</p>

<p>This is not as obscure as one might think. Default system fonts are often really ugly for non-Latin-
using scripts. I have a separate font installed that produces better-looking Devanagari ligatures.</p>

<p>Similarly, some scripts are just more intricate than Latin. My default font size for Devanagari is
set to 18 instead of 16. I’ve started learning Mandarin and I’ve set that font size to 18 as well. Hanzi glyphs
can get pretty complicated and I still struggle to learn (and later recognize) them. A larger font size is great for this.</p>

<p>Anyway, this doesn’t complicate things too much.  This does mean that the font family needs to be
computed before font-size, which already needs to be computed before most other properties. The
language, which can be set using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lang</code> HTML attribute, is internally treated as a CSS property by
Firefox since it inherits, and it must be computed earlier as well.</p>

<p>Not too bad. So far.</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker. This <em>dependence</em> on the language and family <em>inherits</em>.</p>

<p>Quick, what’s the font-size of the inner <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code>?</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 16 --&gt;</span>
    font size is 16px
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font-family: monospace"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 13 --&gt;</span>
        font size is ??
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a normal inherited CSS property<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, if the parent has a computed value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16px</code>,
and the child has no additional values specified, the child will inherit a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16px</code>.
<em>Where</em> the parent got that computed value from doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> “inherits” a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">13px</code>. You can see this below (<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MvorQQ">codepen</a>):</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<div style="font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"> <!-- base size 16 -->
    font size is 16px
    <div style="font-family: monospace"> <!-- base size 13 -->
        font size is ??
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Basically, if the computed value originated from a keyword, whenever the font family or language
change, font-size is recomputed from the original keyword with the new font family and language.</p>

<p>The reason this exists is because otherwise the differing font sizes wouldn’t work anyway! The default font size
is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">medium</code>, so basically the root element gets a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size: medium</code> and all elements inherit from it. If you change
to monospace or a different language in the document you need the font-size recomputed.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t stop here. This even inherits <em>through relative units</em> (Not in IE).</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 16 --&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oewpER">codepen</a>)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<div style="font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"> <!-- base size 16 -->
    font size is 16px
    <div style="font-size: 0.9em"> <!-- could also be font-size: 90%-->
        font size is 14.4px (16 * 0.9)
        <div style="font-family: monospace"> <!-- base size 13 -->
            font size is 11.7px! (13 * 0.9)
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So we’re actually inheriting a font-size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.9*medium</code> when we inherit from the second div, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">14.4px</code>.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is whenever the font family or language changes, you should recompute the font-size as if the language and family <em>were always that way</em> up the tree.</p>

<p>Firefox code uses both of these strategies. The original Gecko style system handles this by actually
going back to the top of the tree and recalculating the font size as if the language/family were
different. I suspect this is inefficient, but the rule tree seems to be involved in making this slightly
more efficient</p>

<p>Servo, on the other hand, stores some extra data on the side when computing stuff, data which gets copied over to the child element. It basically
stores the equivalent of saying “Yes, this font was computed from a keyword. The keyword was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">medium</code>, and after that we applied a factor of 0.9 to it.”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In both cases, this leads to a bunch of complexities in all the <em>other</em> font-size complexities, since they need to be carefully preserved through this.</p>

<p>In Servo, <em>most</em> of this gets handled <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/longhand/font.mako.rs#L964-L1061">via custom cascading functions for font-size</a>.</p>

<h2 id="largersmaller">Larger/smaller</h2>

<p>So I mentioned that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size: larger</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smaller</code> scale the size, but didn’t mention by what fraction.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#relative-size-value">to the spec</a>, if the font-size currently matches the value of an absolute keyword size (medium/large/etc),
you should pick the value of the next/previous keyword sizes respectively.</p>

<p>If it is <em>between</em> two, find the same point between the next/previous two sizes.</p>

<p>This, of course, must play well with the weird inheritance of keyword font sizes mentioned before. In Gecko’s model this isn’t too hard,
since Gecko recalculates things anyway. In Servo’s model we’d have to store a sequence of applications of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">larger</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smaller</code> and relative
units, instead of storing just a relative unit.</p>

<p>Additionally, when computing this during text-zoom, you have to unzoom before looking it up in the table, and then rezoom.</p>

<p>Overall, a bunch of complexity for not much gain — turns out only Gecko actually followed the spec here! All other browser engines
used simple ratios here.</p>

<p>So my fix here <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361550">was simply to remove this behavior from Gecko</a>. That simplified things.</p>

<h2 id="mathml">MathML</h2>

<p>Firefox and Safari support MathML, a markup language for math. It doesn’t get used much on the Web these days, but it exists.</p>

<p>MathML has its own complexities when it comes to font-size. Specifically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptminsize</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptsizemultiplier</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in MathML, the text in the numerator or denominator of a fraction or the text of a superscript is 0.71 times the size of the text outside of it. This is because
the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptsizemultiplier</code> for MathML elements is 0.71, and these specific elements all get a default scriptlevel of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+1</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel=+1</code> means “multiply the font size by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptsizemultiplier</code>”, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel=-1</code> is for dividing. This can be specified via a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code> HTML attribute on an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mstyle</code> element. You can
similarly tweak the (inherited) multiplier via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptsizemultiplier</code> HTML attribute, and the minimum size via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptminsize</code>.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;math&gt;&lt;msup&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;mi&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/mi&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;mn&gt;</span>small superscript<span class="nt">&lt;/mn&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;math&gt;</span>
    text
    <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">+1</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        small
        <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">+1</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
            smaller
            <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">-1</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
                small again
            <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/math&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will show as (you will need Firefox to see the rendered version, Safari supports MathML too but the support isn’t as good):</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<math><msup><mi>text</mi><mn>small superscript</mn></msup></math><br />
<math>text&lt;mstyle scriptlevel=+1&gt; small &lt;mstyle scriptlevel=+1&gt; smaller &lt;mstyle scriptlevel=-1&gt; small again &lt;/mstyle&gt;&lt;/mstyle&gt;&lt;/mstyle&gt;</math>
</div>

<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BdZJgR">codepen</a>)</p>

<p>So this isn’t as bad. It’s as if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code> is a weird <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> unit. No biggie, we know how to deal with those already.</p>

<p>Except you also have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptminsize</code>. This lets you set the minimum font size <em>for changes caused by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code></em>.</p>

<p>This means that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptminsize</code> will make sure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code> never causes changes that make the font smaller than the min size,
but it will ignore cases where you deliberately specify an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> unit or a pixel value.</p>

<p>There’s already a subtle bit of complexity introduced here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code> now becomes another thing
that tweaks how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> inherits. Fortunately, in Firefox/Servo internally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code> (as are
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptminsize</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptsizemultiplier</code>) is also handled as a CSS property, which means that we
can use the same framework we used for font-family and language here – compute the script
properties before font-size, and if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scriptlevel</code> is set, force-recalculate the font size even if
font-size itself was not set.</p>

<h3 id="interlude-early-and-late-computed-properties">Interlude: early and late computed properties</h3>

<p>In Servo the way we handle dependencies in properties is to have a set of “early” properties and a
set of “late” properties (which are allowed to depend on early properties). We iterate the
declarations twice, once looking for early properties, and once for late. However, now we have a
pretty intricate set of dependencies, where font-size must be calculated after language, font-family,
and the script properties, but before everything else that involves lengths. Additionally, font-family
has to be calculated after all the other early properties due to another font complexity I’m not covering here.</p>

<p>The way we handle this is to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3195-L3204">pull font-size and font-family</a> out during the early computation,
but not deal with them until <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3211-L3327">after the early computation is done</a>.</p>

<p>At that stage we first <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3219-L3233">handle the disabling of text-zoom</a>, and then handle <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3235-L3277">the complexities of font-family</a>.</p>

<p>We then <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3280-L3303">compute the font family</a>. If a font size was specified, we <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3305-L3309">just compute that</a>. If it
was not, but a font family, lang, or scriptlevel was specified, we <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3310-L3324">force compute as inherited</a>, which handles all the constraints.</p>

<h3 id="why-scriptminsize-gets-complicated">Why scriptminsize gets complicated</h3>

<p>Unlike with the other “minimum font size”, using an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> unit in any property will calculate the
length with the clamped value, not the “if nothing had been clamped” value, when the font size has
been clamped with scriptminsize. So at first glance handling this seems straightforward; only
consider the script min size when deciding to scale because of scriptlevel.</p>

<p>As always, it’s not that simple 😀:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;math&gt;</span>

                                    This is not 10px/0.75=13.3, rather it is still clamped at 10px
                                        <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">"-1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

                                                This is 11.25px again
                                                    <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">"-1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
                                                        This is 15px again
                                                    <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
                                            <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
                                        <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
                                <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
                        <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/math&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wqepjo">codepen</a>)</p>

<p>Basically, if you increase the level a bunch of times after hitting the min size, decreasing it by one should not immediately
compute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min size / multiplier</code>. That would make things asymmetric; something with a net script level of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+5</code> should
have the same size as something with a net script level of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+6 -1</code>, provided the multiplier hasn’t changed.</p>

<p>So what happens is that the script level is calculated against the font size <em>as if scriptminsize had never applied</em>,
and we only use that size if it is greater than the min size.</p>

<p>It’s not just a matter of keeping track of the script level at which clamping happened – the multiplier could change
in the process and you need to keep track of that too. So this ends up in creating <em>yet another font-size value to inherit</em>.</p>

<p>To recap, we are now at <em>four</em> different notions of font size being inherited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The main font size used by styling</li>
  <li>The “actual” font size, i.e. the main font size but clamped by the min size</li>
  <li>(In servo only) The “keyword” size; i.e. the size stored as a keyword and ratio, if it was derived from a keyword</li>
  <li>The “script unconstrained” size; the font size as if scriptminsize never existed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another complexity here is that the following should still work:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;math&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptminsize=</span><span class="s">"10px"</span> <span class="na">scriptsizemultiplier=</span><span class="s">"0.75"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font-size: 5px"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    5px
    <span class="nt">&lt;mstyle</span> <span class="na">scriptlevel=</span><span class="s">"-1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        6.666px
    <span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/mstyle&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/math&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/prwpVd">codepen</a>)</p>

<p>Basically, if you were already below the scriptminsize, reducing the script level (to increase the font size) should not get clamped, since then you’d get something too large.</p>

<p>This basically means you only apply scriptminsize if you are applying the script level to a value <em>greater than</em> the script min size.</p>

<p>In Servo, all of the MathML handling culminates in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/gecko.mako.rs#L2304-L2403">this wonderful function that is more comment than code</a>, and
some code in the functions near it.</p>

<hr />

<p>So there you have it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> is actually pretty complicated. A lot of the web platform has hidden complexities like this, and it’s always fun to encounter more of them.</p>

<p>(Perhaps less fun when I have to implement them 😂)</p>

      <p>Interestingly, in Firefox, this number is 50% for all ruby <em>except</em> for when the language is Taiwanese Mandarin (where it is 30%). This is because Taiwan uses a phonetic script called Bopomofo, and each Han glyph can be represented as a maximum of 3 Bopomofo letters. So it is possible to choose a reasonable minimum size such that the ruby never extends the size of the glyph below it. On the other hand, pinyin can be up to six letters, and Hiragana up to (I think) 5, and the corresponding “no overflow” scaling will be too tiny. So fitting them on top of the glyph is not a consideration and instead we elect to have a larger font size for better readability. Additionally, Bopomofo ruby is often set on the side of the glyph instead of on top, and 30% works better there.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been thinking about this a lot these days. In part because of <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/issues/1737">an idea I had</a>
but also due to <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/863829482645340160">this twitter discussion</a>.</p>

<p>When teaching most things, there are two non-mutually-exclusive ways of approaching the problem. One
is “proactive”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, which is where the teacher decides a learning path beforehand, and executes it. The
other is “reactive”, where the teacher reacts to the student trying things out and dynamically
tailors the teaching experience.</p>

<p>Most in-person teaching experiences are a mix of both. Planning beforehand is very important whilst teaching,
but tailoring the experience to the student’s reception of the things being taught is important too.</p>

<p>In person, you <em>can</em> mix these two, and in doing so you get a “best of both worlds” situation. Yay!</p>

<p>But … we don’t really learn much programming in a classroom setup.
Sure, some folks learn the basics in college for a few years, but everything
they learn after that isn’t in a classroom situation where this can work<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
I’m an autodidact,
and while I have taken a few programming courses for random interesting things, I’ve taught myself most of what I know
using various sources. I care a lot about improving the situation here.</p>

<p>With self-driven learning we have a similar divide. The “proactive” model corresponds to reading books
and docs. Various people have proactively put forward a path for learning in the form of a book
or tutorial. It’s up to you to pick one, and follow it.</p>

<p>The “reactive” model is not so well-developed. In the context of self-driven learning in programming,
it’s basically “do things, make mistakes, hope that Google/Stackoverflow help”. It’s how
a lot of people learn programming; and it’s how I prefer to learn programming.</p>

<p>It’s very nice to be able to “learn along the way”. While this is a long and arduous process,
involving many false starts and a lack of a sense of progress, it can be worth it in terms of
the kind of experience this gets you.</p>

<p>But as I mentioned, this isn’t as well-developed. With the proactive approach, there still
is a teacher – the author of the book! That teacher may not be able to respond in real time,
but they’re able to set forth a path for you to work through.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with the “reactive” approach, there is no teacher. Sure, there are
Random Answers on the Internet, which are great, but they don’t form a coherent story.
Neither can you really be your own teacher for a topic you do not understand.</p>

<p>Yet plenty of folks do this. Plenty of folks approach things like learning a new language by reading
at most two pages of docs and then just diving straight in and trying stuff out. The only language I
have not done this for is the first language I learned<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I think it’s unfortunate that folks who prefer this approach don’t get the benefit of a teacher.
In the reactive approach, teachers can still tell you what you’re doing wrong and steer you away from
tarpits of misunderstanding. They can get you immediate answers and guidance. When we look
for answers on stackoverflow, we get some of this, but it also involves a lot of pattern-matching
on the part of the student, and we end up with a bad facsimile of what a teacher can do for you.</p>

<p>But it’s possible to construct a better teacher for this!</p>

<p>In fact, examples of this exist in the wild already!</p>

<p>The Elm compiler is my favorite example of this. <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants">It has amazing error messages</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/elm-error.png" />
<img class="center" src="/images/post/elm-error2.png" /></p>

<p>The error messages tell you what you did wrong, sometimes suggest fixes, and help
correct potential misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Rust does this too. Many compilers do. (Elm is exceptionally good at it)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/rust-error.png" width="700" /></p>

<p>One thing I particularly like about Rust is that from that error you can
try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rustc --explain E0373</code> and get a terminal-friendly version
of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/error-index.html#E0373">this help text</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, diagnostics basically provide a reactive component to learning programming. I’ve cared about
diagnostics in Rust for a long time, and I often remind folks that many things taught through the
docs can/should be taught through diagnostics too. Especially because diagnostics are a kind of soapbox
for compiler writers — you can’t guarantee that your docs will be read, but you can guarantee
that your error messages will. These days, while I don’t have much time to work on stuff myself I’m
very happy to mentor others working on improving diagnostics in Rust.</p>

<p>Only recently did I realize <em>why</em> I care about them so much – they cater exactly to my approach
to learning programming languages! If I’m not going to read the docs when I get started and try the
reactive approach, having help from the compiler is invaluable.</p>

<p>I think this space is relatively unexplored. Elm might have the best diagnostics out there,
and as diagnostics (helping all users of a language – new and experienced), they’re great,
but as a teaching tool for newcomers; they still have a long way to go. Of course, compilers
like Rust are even further behind.</p>

<p>One thing I’d like to experiment with is a first-class tool for reactive teaching. In a sense,
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">clippy</a> is already something like this. Clippy looks out for antipatterns, and tries to help
teach. But it also does many other things, and not all are teaching moments are antipatterns.</p>

<p>For example, in C, this isn’t necessarily an antipattern:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">thingy</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">do_the_thing</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">frob</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many C codebases use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (foo = bar())</code>. It is a potential footgun if you confuse it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>,
but there’s no way to be sure. Many compilers now have a warning for this that you can silence by
doubling the parentheses, though.</p>

<p>In Rust, this isn’t an antipattern either:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nf">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c">// num is still 0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For someone new to Rust, they may feel that the way to have a function mutate arguments (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num</code>) passed to it
is to use something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mut x: u8</code>. What this actually does is copies <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num</code> (because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u8</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> type),
and allows you to mutate the copy within the scope of the function. The right way to make a function that
mutates arguments passed to it by-reference would be to do something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn add_one(x: &amp;mut u8)</code>.
If you try the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mut x</code> thing for non-Copy values, you’d get a “reading out of moved value” error
when you try to access <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num</code> after calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_one</code>. This would help you figure out what you did wrong,
and potentially that error could detect this situation and provide more specific help.</p>

<p>But for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types, this will just compile. And it’s not an antipattern – the way this works
makes complete sense in the context of how Rust variables work, and is something that you do need
to use at times.</p>

<p>So we can’t even warn on this. Perhaps in “pedantic clippy” mode, but really, it’s not
a pattern we want to discourage. (At least in the C example that pattern is one
that many people prefer to forbid from their codebase)</p>

<p>But it would be nice if we could tell a learning programmer “hey, btw, this is what this syntax
means, are you sure you want to do this?”. With explanations and the ability to dismiss the error.</p>

<p>In fact, you don’t even need to restrict this to potential footguns!</p>

<p>You can detect various things the learner is trying to do. Are they probably mixing up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;str</code>? Help them! Are they writing a trait? Give a little tooltip explaining the feature.</p>

<p>This is beginning to remind me of the original “office assistant” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a>, which was super annoying.
But an opt-in tool or IDE feature which gives helpful suggestions could still be nice, especially
if you can strike a balance between being so dense it is annoying and so sparse it is useless.</p>

<p>It also reminds me of well-designed tutorial modes in games. Some games have a tutorial mode that guides you
through a set path of doing things. Other games, however, have a tutorial mode that will give you hints even
if you stray off the beaten path. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi">Michael</a> tells me that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey/">Prey</a> is
a recent example of such a game.</p>

<p>This really feels like it fits the “reactive” model I prefer. The student gets to mold their own
journey, but gets enough helpful hints and nudges from the “teacher” (the tool) so that they
don’t end up wasting too much time and can make informed decisions on how to proceed learning.</p>

<p>Now, rust-clippy isn’t exactly the place for this kind of tool. This tool needs the ability to globally
“silence” a hint once you’ve learned it. rust-clippy is a linter, and while you can silence lints in
your code, you can’t silence them globally for the current user. Nor does that really make sense.</p>

<p>But rust-clippy does have the infrastructure for writing stuff like this, so it’s an ideal prototyping
point. I’ve filed <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/issues/1737">this issue</a> to discuss this topic.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I’d love to see this as an IDE feature.</p>

<p>I’d also like to see more experimentation in the department of “reactive” teaching — not just tools like this.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: This post was written before the Rust 2018 edition, and does not yet incorporate the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/module-system/index.html">changes made to the module system</a>.</em></p>

<p>The module and import system in Rust is sadly one of the many confusing things you have to deal with whilst
learning the language. A lot of these confusions stem from a misunderstanding of how it works.
In explaining this I’ve seen that it’s usually a common set of misunderstandings.</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/youre-doing-it-wrong/">“You’re doing it wrong”</a>, I want to try and explain one
“right” way of looking at it. You can go pretty far<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> without knowing this, but it’s useful
and helps avoid confusion.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>First off, just to get this out of the way, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod foo;</code> is basically a way of saying
“look for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.rs</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo/mod.rs</code> and make a module named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> with its contents”.
It’s the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod foo { ... }</code> except the contents are in a different file. This
itself can be confusing at first, but it’s not what I wish to focus on here. The Rust book explains this more
in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html#multiple-file-crates">the chapter on modules</a>.</p>

<p>In the examples here I will just be using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod foo { ... }</code> since multi-file examples are annoying,
but keep in mind that the stuff here applies equally to multi-file crates.</p>

<p>These examples remind me of the “point at infinity” in elliptic curve crypto or fake particles in
physics or fake lattice elements in various fields of CS<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Sometimes, for something to make sense,
you add in things that don’t normally exist. Similarly, these examples may contain code which
is not traditional Rust style, but the import system
still makes more sense when you include them.</p>

<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>

<p>The core confusion behind how imports work can really be resolved by remembering two rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::bar::baz</code> resolves <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> relative to the root module (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib.rs</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.rs</code>)
    <ul>
      <li>You can resolve relative to the current module by explicily trying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use self::foo::bar::baz</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo::bar::baz</code> within your code<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> resolves <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> relative to the current module
    <ul>
      <li>You can resolve relative to the root by explicitly using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::foo::bar::baz</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s actually … it. There are no further caveats. The rest of this is modelling what
constitutes as “being within a module”.</p>

<p>Let’s take a pretty standard setup, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate</code> declarations are placed in the the root
module:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">extern</span> <span class="n">crate</span> <span class="n">regex</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">regex</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Regex</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c">// won't work</span>
        <span class="c">// let ex = regex::Regex::new("");</span>
        <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">ex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Regex</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">""</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate regex</code>, we pull in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regex</code> crate into the crate root. This behaves
pretty similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod regex { /* contents of regex crate */}</code>. Basically, we’ve imported
the crate into the crate root, and since all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> paths are relative to the crate root,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use regex::Regex</code> works fine inside the module.</p>

<p>Inline in code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regex::Regex</code> won’t work because as mentioned before inline paths are relative
to the current module. However, you can try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::regex::Regex::new("")</code>.</p>

<p>Since we’ve imported <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regex::Regex</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod foo</code>, that name is now accessible to everything inside
the module directly, so the code can just say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regex::new()</code>.</p>

<p>The way you can view this is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use blah</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate blah</code> create an item named
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blah</code> “within the module”, which is basically something like a symbolic link, saying
“yes this item named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blah</code> is actually elsewhere but we’ll pretend it’s within the module”</p>

<p>The error message from this code may further drive this home:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">mem</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="http://play.integer32.com/?gist=07527a61153519fbf218ffb93f13b3cd&amp;version=undefined">playpen</a>)</p>

<p>The error I get is</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>error: function `replace` is private
 --&gt; src/main.rs:3:5
  |

  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s no function named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replace</code> in the module <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>! But the compiler seems to think there is?</p>

<p>That’s because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use std::mem::replace</code> basically is equivalent to there being something like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c">// here we can refer to `replace` freely (in inline paths)</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">whatever</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c">// ...</span>
        <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">something</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blah</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="c">// ...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>except it’s actually like a symlink to the function defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::mem</code>. Because inline paths
are relative to the current module, saying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use std::mem::replace</code> works as if you had defined
a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replace</code> in the same module, and you can refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replace()</code> without needing
any extra qualification in inline paths.</p>

<p>This also makes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pub use</code> fit perfectly in our model. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pub use</code> says “make this symlink, but let
others see it too”:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// works now!</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">mem</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Folks often get annoyed when this doesn’t work:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c">// nope</span>
    <span class="c">// use mem::replace;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As mentioned before, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> paths are relative to the root module. There is no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mem</code>
in the root module, so this won’t work. We can make it work via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, which I mentioned
before:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c">// yep!</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">mem</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that this brings overloading of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> keyword up to a grand total of <em>four</em>! Two cases
which occur in the import/path system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use self::foo</code> means “find me <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> within the current module”</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::bar::{self, baz}</code> is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::bar; use foo::bar::baz;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn foo(&amp;self)</code> lets you define methods and specify if the receiver is by-move, borrowed, mutably borrowed, or other</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Self</code> within implementations lets you refer to the type being implemented on</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh well, at least it’s not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Going back to one of the examples I gave at the beginning:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">;</span>


<span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">mem</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">transmute</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">transmute</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="http://play.integer32.com/?gist=49415d74214b07b13c236ce88bdf54aa&amp;version=undefined">playpen</a>)</p>

<p>It should be clearer now why this works. The root module imports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mem</code>. Now, from everyone’s point
of view, there’s an item called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mem</code> in the root.</p>

<p>Within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod foo</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use mem::transmute</code> works because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> is relative to the root, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mem</code>
already exists in the root! When you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> something, all child modules will see it as if it were
actually belonging to the module. (Non-child modules won’t see it because of privacy, we
saw an example of this already)</p>

<p>This is why <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::transmute</code> works from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod bar</code>, too. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> can refer to the contents
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::whatever</code>, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> is a child of the root module, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> is relative
to the root. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> already has an item named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transmute</code> inside it because it imported one.
Nothing in the parent module is private from the child, so we can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::transmute</code> from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code>.</p>

<p>Generally, the standard way of doing things is to either not use modules (just a single lib.rs),
or, if you do use modules, put nothing other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod</code>s in the root.
This is why we rarely see shenanigans like the above; there’s nothing in the root crate
to import, aside from other crates specified by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate</code>. The trick of
“reimport something from the parent module” is also pretty rare because there’s basically no
point to using that (just import it directly!). So this is not the kind of code
you’ll see in the wild.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Basically, the way the import system works can be summed up as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> will act as if they were defining the imported item in the current module, like a symbolic link</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::bar::baz</code> resolves the path relative to the root module</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo::bar::baz</code> in an inline path (i.e. not in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code>) will resolve relative to the current module</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the root module</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the current module</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">super::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the parent module</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, on to the other half of this. Privacy.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<p>So how does privacy work?</p>

<p>Privacy, too, follows some basic rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you can access a module, you can access all of its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pub</code> contents</li>
  <li>A module can always access its child modules, but not recursively
    <ul>
      <li>This means that a module cannot access private items in its children, nor can it access private grandchildren modules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A child can always access its parent modules (and their parents), and <em>all</em> their contents</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pub(restricted)</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1422-pub-restricted.md">is a proposal</a> which extends this a bit, but it’s experimental so we won’t deal with it here</li>
</ul>

<p>Giving some examples,</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c">// can access `foo::foofunc`, even though `foofunc` is private</span>

        <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">barfunc</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="c">// can access `foo::bar::barfunc()`, even though `bar` is private</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">foofunc</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c">// We can access our parent and _all_ its contents,</span>
        <span class="c">// so we have access to `foo::baz`. We can access</span>
        <span class="c">// all pub contents of modules we have access to, so we</span>
        <span class="c">// can access `foo::baz::bazfunc`</span>
        <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">baz</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">bazfunc</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">baz</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">bazfunc</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to note that this is all contextual; whether or not a particular
path works is a function of where you are. For example, this works<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="cm">/* not pub */</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">baz</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">bazfunc</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">quux</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">bar</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">baz</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">bazfunc</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are able to write the path <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo::bar::baz::bazfunc</code> even though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> is private!</p>

<p>This is because we still have <em>access</em> to the module <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code>, by being a descendent module.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Hopefully this is helpful to some of you. I’m not really sure how this can fit into the official
docs, but if you have ideas, feel free to adapt it<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>!</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>This is because most of these misunderstandings lead to a model where you think fewer things compile, which is fine as long as it isn’t too restrictive. Having a mental model where you feel more things will compile than actually do is what leads to frustration; the opposite can just be restrictive. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>One example closer to home is how Rust does lifetime resolution. Lifetimes form a lattice with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> being the bottom element. There is no top element for lifetimes in Rust syntax, but internally <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/rustc/ty/enum.Region.html#variant.ReEmpty">there is the “empty lifetime”</a> which is used during borrow checking. If something resolves to have an empty lifetime, it can’t exist, so we get a lifetime error. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>When I say “within your code”, I mean “anywhere but a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> statement”. I may also term these as “inline paths”. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>My little student must think it queer<br />

He wonders what the poem meant<br /></p>

<p>He gives his head a little shake<br />
To ask if there is some mistake<br />
“That’s not what the author said!”<br />
Providing another view instead<br /></p>

<p>The words are lovely, dark, and deep<br />

<p>Seriously though, try reading <em>The Road Not Taken</em> as metacircular commentary on how the poem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#Analysis">is very often “mis”interpreted</a>, and the nature of interpretation / <em>Death of the Author</em>. It fits perfectly when
you read “road” as “interpretation”.</p>

<p><small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A colleague of mine learning Rust had an interesting type / borrow checker error. The solution needs
a less-used feature of Rust (which basically exists precisely for this kind of thing), so I thought
I’d document it.</p>

<p>The code was like this:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">maybe_foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_condition</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>I’m only going to be changing the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> here.</p>

<p>What’s happening here is that a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> type, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>, is returned in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>. In one case,
we have a reference to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>, and in another case an owned copy.</p>

<p>We want to set a variable to these, but of course we can’t because they’re different types.</p>

<p>In one case, we have an owned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>, and we can usually obtain a borrow from an owned type. For
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>, there’s a convenience method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.as_ref()</code> that does this<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Let’s try using that (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=41c3f836b9485c216ccb05c257ae5326&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>):</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">maybe_foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_condition</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_owned</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="nf">.as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us an error.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>error: borrowed value does not live long enough
  --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:32:5
   |
31 |         thing.get_owned().as_ref()
   |         ----------------- temporary value created here
32 |     };
   |     ^ temporary value dropped here while still borrowed
...
35 | }
   | - temporary value needs to live until here

error: aborting due to previous error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thing.get_owned()</code> returns an owned value. There’s nothing that it gets anchored to
(we don’t set its value to a variable), so it is just a temporary – we can call methods on it, but
once we’re done the value will go out of scope.</p>

<p>What we want is something like</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">maybe_foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_condition</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_owned</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">owned</span><span class="nf">.as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but this will still give a borrow error – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owned</code> will still go out of scope within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> block,
and we need the reference to it last as long as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybe_foo</code> (outside the block) is supposed to last.</p>

<p>So this is no good.</p>

<p>An alternate solution here <em>can</em> be copying/cloning the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> in the <em>first</em> case by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.map(|x|
x.clone())</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.cloned()</code> or something. Sometimes you don’t want to clone, so this isn’t great.</p>

<p>Another solution here – the generic advice for dealing with values which may be owned or borrow –
is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cow</code>. It does incur a runtime check, though; one which can be optimized out if things are
inlined enough.</p>

<p>What we need to do here is to extend the lifetime of the temporary returned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thing.get_owned()</code>.
We need to extend it <em>past</em> the scope of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code> outside that scope which we mutate (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=7868045f2cebec6d23e7a065f5823767&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>).</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">None</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">maybe_foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_condition</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_owned</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">owned</span><span class="nf">.as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works in this case, but in this case we already had an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_ref()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_owned()</code>
returned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;Foo</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> respectively, then we’d need to do something like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">None</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">maybe_foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_condition</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thing</span><span class="nf">.get_owned</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="n">owned</span><span class="nf">.as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="nf">.unwrap</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is icky since it introduces an unwrap.</p>

<p>What we really need is a way to signal to the compiler that it needs to hold on to that temporary
for the scope of the enclosing block.</p>

<p>We can do that! (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1ddf2a428e73b01baa72acdad7cbbf2b&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>)</p>

<p>We know that Rust doesn’t do “uninitialized” variables. If you want to name a variable, you have to
initialize it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let foo;</code> feels rather like magic in this context, because it looks like we’ve declared
an uninitialized variable.</p>

<p>What’s less well known is that Rust <em>can</em> do “deferred” initialization. Here, you declare a variable
and can initialize it later, but expressions involving the variable can only exist in branches
where the compiler knows it has been initialized.</p>

<p>This is the case here. We declared the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owned</code> variable beforehand. It now lives in the outer scope
and won’t be destroyed until the end of the outer scope. However, the variable cannot be used directly
in an expression in the first branch, or after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>. Doing so will give a compile time error
saying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use of possibly uninitialized variable: `owned`</code>. We can only use it in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> branch
because the compiler can see that it is unconditionally initialized in that branch.</p>

<p>We can still read the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owned</code> indirectly through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybe_foo</code> from outside the branch.
This is okay because the storage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owned</code> is guaranteed to live as long as the outer scope,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybe_foo</code> borrows from it. The only time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybe_foo</code> is set to a value inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owned</code> is when
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owned</code> has been initialized, so it is safe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“You’re doing it wrong”</p>

<p>A common refrain in issue trackers and discussion forums everywhere. In isolation,
it’s a variant of RTFM – give a non-answer when someone wants help, and bounce them
back to a manual or docs which they probably have already read. Not very helpful,
and not useful to anyone. Of course, one can accompany it with a nice explanation
of how to do it right; “You’re doing it wrong” isn’t always a bad thing :)</p>

<p>Especially when it comes to programming languages, but in general in the context of any programming
tool or library, “you’re doing it wrong” is almost always due to a “bad” mental model. The person, whilst
learning, has built a mental model of how the tool works, but this doesn’t accurately reflect
reality. Other times, it does reflect reality, but it does not reflect the mental model of the
maintainers (there can be multiple valid ways of looking at something!),
which leads to an impedance mismatch when reading docs or error messages.</p>

<p>In other cases, “doing it wrong” is a <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/178438">case of the XY problem</a>, where the user has problem X,
and think they can solve it with solution Y, and end up asking how they can achieve Y. This happens pretty
often — folks may be approaching your technology with prior experience with related things
that work differently, and may think the same idioms apply.</p>

<p>When I was at <a href="https://maintainerati.org/">WONTFIX</a>, someone who had done support work in the past mentioned that one
thing everyone learns in support is <strong>“the user is always wrong …. and it’s not their fault!”</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good template for an attitude to approach “doing it wrong” questions about your
technology on online forums as well. And this doesn’t just benefit the users who ask questions,
this attitude can benefit your technology!</p>

<p>Back when I used to be more active contributing to the Rust compiler, I also used to hang out in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#rust</code> a lot, and often answer newbie questions (now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#rust-beginners</code> exists too, and I hang out
in both, but I don’t really actively participate as much). One thing I learned to do was probe
deeper into why people hit that confusion in the first place. It’s almost always a “bad” mental
model. Rust is rarely the first programming language folks learn, and people approach it with
preconceptions about how programming works. This isn’t unique to Rust, this happens any time someone
learns a language with a different paradigm — learning C or C++ after doing a GCd language,
learning a functional language after an imperative one, statically typed after dynamic, or one of
the many other axes by which programming languages differ.</p>

<p>Other times, it’s just assumptions they made when reading between the lines of whatever resource
they used to learn the language.</p>

<p>So, anyway, folks often have a “bad” mental model. If we are able to identify that model and correct
it, we have saved that person from potentially getting confused at every step in the future. Great!</p>

<p>With a <em>tiny</em> bit more effort, however, we can do one step better. Not for that person, but for
ourselves! We can probe a bit more and try to understand what caused them to obtain that mental
model. And fix the docs so that it never happens again! Of course, not everyone reads the docs, but
that’s what diagnostics are for (in the case of errors). They’re a tool to help us nudge the user
towards the right mental model, whilst helping them fix their immediate problem. Rust has for a long
time had pretty great diagnostics, with improvements happening all the time<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I think this is at
least in part due to the attitude of the folks in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#rust</code>; always trying to figure out how to
preempt various confusions they see.</p>

<p>It’s a good attitude to have. I hope more folks, both in and out of the Rust community, approach
“You’re doing it wrong” cases like that.</p>

      <p>Diagnostics issues are often the easiest way to contribute to the compiler itself, so if you want to contribute, I suggest starting there. Willing to mentor! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
