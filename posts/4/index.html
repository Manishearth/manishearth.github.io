  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Update: This post got a sequel, <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/01/15/breaking-our-latin-1-assumptions/">Breaking our latin-1 assumptions</a>.</em></p>

<p>I’ve seen misconceptions about Unicode crop up regularly in posts discussing it. One very common
misconception I’ve seen is that <em>code points have cross-language intrinsic meaning</em>.</p>

<p>It usually comes up when people are comparing UTF8 and UTF32. Folks start implying that code points
<em>mean</em> something, and that O(1) indexing or slicing at code point boundaries is a useful operation.
I’ve also seen this assumption manifest itself in actual programs which make incorrect assumptions
about the nature of code points and mess things up when fed non-Latin text.</p>

<p>If you like reading about unicode, you might also want to go through <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2015/09/12/dark-corners-of-unicode/">Eevee’s article</a>
on the dark corners of unicode. Great read!</p>

<h2 id="encodings">Encodings</h2>

<p>So, anyway, we have some popular encodings for Unicode. UTF8 encodes 7-bit code points as a single
byte, 11-bit code points as two bytes, 16-bit code points as 3 bytes, and 21-bit code points as four
bytes. UTF-16 encodes the first three in two bytes, and the last one as four bytes (logically, a
pair of two-byte code units). UTF-32 encodes all code points as 4-byte code units. UTF-16 is mostly
a “worst of both worlds” compromise at this point, and the main programming language I can think of
that uses it (and exposes it in this form) is Javascript, and that too in a broken way.</p>

<p>The nice thing about UTF8 is that it saves space. Of course, that is subjective and dependent on
the script you use most commonly, for example my first name is 12 bytes in UTF-8 but only 4
in ISCII (or a hypothetical unicode-based encoding that swapped the Devanagri Unicode block with
the ASCII block). It also uses more space over the very non-hypothetical UTF-16 encoding if you
tend to use code points in the U+0800 - U+FFFF range. It always uses less space than UTF-32 however.</p>

<p>A commonly touted disadvantage of UTF-8 is that string indexing is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code>. Because code points take
up a variable number of bytes, you won’t know where the 5th codepoint is until you scan the string
and look for it. UTF-32 doesn’t have this problem; it’s always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 * index</code> bytes away.</p>

<p>The problem here is that indexing by code point shouldn’t be an operation you ever need!</p>

<h2 id="indexing-by-code-point">Indexing by code point</h2>

<p>The main time you want to be able to index by code point is if you’re implementing algorithms
defined in the unicode spec that operate on unicode strings (casefolding, segmentation, NFD/NFC).
Most if not all of these algorithms operate on whole strings, so implementing them
as an iteration pass is usually necessary anyway, so you don’t lose anything if you can’t
do arbitrary code point indexing.</p>

<p>But for application logic, dealing with code points doesn’t really make sense. This is because
code points have no intrinsic meaning. They are not “characters”. I’m using scare quotes here
because a “character” isn’t a well-defined concept either, but we’ll get to that later.</p>

<p>For example, “é” is two code points (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code> +<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> ́</code>), where one of them is a combining accent. My name,
“मनीष”, visually looks like three “characters”, but is four code points. The “नी” is made up of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">न</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ी</code>. My last name contains a “character” made up of three code points (as well as multiple other two-code-point
“characters”). The flag emoji “🇺🇸” is also made of two code points, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">🇺</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">🇸</code>.</p>

<p>One false assumption that’s often made is that code points are a single column wide. They’re not.
They sometimes bunch up to form characters that fit in single “columns”. This is often dependent on
the font, and if your application relies on this, you should be querying the font. There are even
code points like U+FDFD (﷽) which are often rendered multiple columns wide. In fact, in my
<em>monospace</em> font in my text editor, that character is rendered <em>almost</em> 12 columns wide. Yes,
“almost”, subsequent characters get offset a tiny bit, presumably because the font selection
picking a non-monospace font for the character.</p>

<p>Another false assumption is that editing actions (selection, backspace, cut, paste) operate on code
points. In both Chrome and Firefox, selection will often include multiple code points. All the
multi-code-point examples I gave above fall into this category. An interesting testcase for this is
the string “ᄀᄀᄀ각ᆨᆨ”, which will rarely if ever render as a single “character” but will be considered
as one for the purposes of selection, pretty much universally. I’ll get to why this is later.</p>

<p>Backspace can gobble multiple code points at once too, but the heuristics are different. The reason
behind this is that backspace needs to mirror the act of typing, and while typing sometimes
constructs multi-codepoint characters, backspace decomposes it piece by piece. In cases where a
multi-codepoint “character” <em>can</em> be logically decomposed (e.g. “letter + accent”), backspace will
decompose it, by removing the accent or whatever. But some multi-codepoint characters are not
“constructions” of general concepts that should be exposed to the user. For example, a user should
never need to know that the “🇺🇸” flag emoji is made of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">🇺</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">🇸</code>, and hitting backspace on it should
delete both codepoints. Similarly, variation selectors and other such code points shouldn’t
be treated as their own unit when backspacing.</p>

<p>On my Mac most builtin apps (which I presume use the OSX UI toolkits) seem to use the same
heuristics that Firefox/Chrome use for selection for both selection and backspace. While the
treatment of code points in editing contexts is not consistent, it seems like applications
consistently do not consider code points as “editing units”.</p>

<p>Now, it is true that you often need <em>some</em> way to index a string. For example, if you have a large
document and need to represent a slice of it. This could be a user-selection, or something delimeted
by markup. Basically, you’ve already gone through the document and have a section you want to be
able to refer to later without copying it out.</p>

<p>However, you don’t need code point indexing here, byte
indexing works fine! UTF8 is designed so that you can check if you’re on a code point boundary even
if you just byte-index directly. It does this by restricting the kinds of bytes allowed. One-byte
code points never have the high bit set (ASCII). All other code points have the high bit set in each
byte. The first byte of multibyte codepoints always starts with a sequence that specifies the number
of bytes in the codepoint, and such sequences can’t be found in the lower-order bytes of any
multibyte codepoint. You can see this visually in the table <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description">here</a>. The upshot of all this
is that you just need to check the current byte if you want to be sure you’re on a codepoint
boundary, and if you receive an arbitrarily byte-sliced string, you will not mistake it for
something else. It’s not possible to have a valid code point be a subslice of another, or form a
valid code point by subslicing a sequence of two different ones by cutting each in half.</p>

<p>So all you need to do is keep track of the byte indices, and use them for slicing it later.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s important to always remember that “code point” doesn’t have intrinsic meaning. If
you need to do a segmentation operation on a string, find out what <em>exactly</em> you’re looking for, and
what concept maps closest to that. It’s rare that “code point” is the concept you’re looking for.
In <em>most</em> cases, what you’re looking for instead is “grapheme cluster”.</p>

<h2 id="grapheme-clusters">Grapheme clusters</h2>

<p>The concept of a “character” is a nebulous one. Is “각” a single character, or
three? How about “नी”? Or “நி”? Or the “👨‍❤️‍👨” emoji<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>? Or the “👨‍👨‍👧‍👧” family emoji<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>?
Different scripts have different concepts which may not clearly map to the Latin notion of “letter”
or our programmery notion of “character”.</p>

<p>Unicode itself gives the term <a href="http://unicode.org/glossary/#character">“character”</a> multiple incompatible meanings, and as
far as I know doesn’t use the term in any normative text.</p>

<p>Often, you need to deal with what is actually displayed to the user. A lot of terminal emulators do
this wrong, and end up messing up cursor placement. I used to use irssi-xmpp to keep my Facebook and
Gchat conversations in my IRC client, but I eventually stopped as I was increasingly chatting in
Marathi or Hindi and I prefer using the actual script over romanizing<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and it would just break
my terminal<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Also, they got rid of the XMPP bridge but I’d already cut down on it by then.</p>

<p>So sometimes, you need an API querying what the font is doing. Generally, when talking about the
actual rendered image, the term “glyph” or “glyph image” is used.</p>

<p>However, you can’t always query the font. Text itself exists independent of rendering, and sometimes
you need a rendering-agnostic way of segmenting it into “characters”.</p>

<p>For this, Unicode has a concept of <a href="http://unicode.org/glossary/#grapheme_cluster">“grapheme cluster”</a>. There’s also “extended grapheme
cluster” (EGC), which is basically an updated version of the concept. In this post, whenever
I use the term “grapheme cluster”, I am talking about EGCs.</p>

<p>The term is defined and explored in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries">UAX #29</a>. It starts by pinning down the still-nebulous
concept of “user-perceived character” (“a basic unit of a writing system for a language”),
and then declares the concept of a “grapheme cluster” to be an approximation to this notion
that we can determine programmatically.</p>

<p>A rough definition of grapheme cluster is a “horizontally segmentable unit of text”.</p>

<p>The spec goes into detail as to the exact algorithm that segments text at grapheme cluster
boundaries. All of the examples I gave in the first paragraph of this section are single grapheme
clusters. So is “ᄀᄀᄀ각ᆨᆨ” (or “ᄀᄀᄀ각ᆨᆨ”), which apparently is considered a
single syllable block in Hangul even though it is not of the typical form of leading consonant +
vowel + optional tail consonant, but is not something you’d see in modern Korean. The spec
explicitly talks of this case so it seems to be on purpose. I like this string because nothing I
know of renders it as a single glyph; so you can easily use it to tell if a particular segmentation-
aware operation uses grapheme clusters as segmentation. If you try and select it, in most browsers
you will be forced to select the whole thing, but backspace will delete the jamos one by one. For
the second string, backspace will decompose the core syllable block too (in the first string the
syllable block 각 is “precomposed” as a single code point, in the second one I
built it using combining jamos).</p>

<p>Basically, unless you have very specific requirements or are able to query the font, use an API that
segments strings into grapheme clusters wherever you need to deal with the notion of “character”.</p>

<h2 id="language-defaults">Language defaults</h2>

<p>Now, a lot of languages by default are now using Unicode-aware encodings. This is great. It gets rid
of the misconception that characters are one byte long.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t get rid of the misconception that user-perceived characters are one code point long.</p>

<p>There are only two languages I know of which handle this well: Swift and Perl 6. I don’t know much
about Perl 6’s thing so I can’t really comment on it, but I am really happy with what Swift does:</p>

<p>In Swift, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Character</code> type is an extended grapheme cluster. This does mean that a
character itself is basically a string, since EGCs can be arbitrarily many code points long.</p>

<p>All the APIs by default deal with EGCs. The length of a string is the number of EGCs in it. They
are indexed by EGC. Iteration yields EGCs. The default comparison algorithm uses unicode
canonical equivalence, which I think is kind of neat. Of course, APIs that work with code
points are exposed too, you can iterate over the code points using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.unicodeScalars</code>.</p>

<p>The internal encoding itself is … weird (and as far as I can tell not publicly exposed), but as a
higher level language I think it’s fine to do things like that.</p>

<p>I strongly feel that languages should be moving in this direction, having defaults involving
grapheme clusters.</p>

<p>Rust, for example, gets a lot of things right – it has UTF-8 strings. It internally uses byte
indices in slices. Explicit slicing usually uses byte indices too, and will panic if out of bounds.
The non-O(1) methods are all explicit, since you will use an iterator to perform the operation (E.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.chars().nth(5)</code>). This encourages people to <em>think</em> about the cost, and it also  encourages people
to coalesce the cost with nearby iterations – if you are going to do multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code> things, do
them in a single iteration! Rust <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code>s represent code points. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.char_indices()</code> is
a useful string iteration method that bridges the gap between byte indexing and code points.</p>

<p>However, while the documentation does mention grapheme clusters, the stdlib is not aware of the
concept of grapheme clusters at all. The default “fundamental” unit of the string in Rust is
a code point, and the operations revolve around that. If you want grapheme clusters, you
may use <a href="https://unicode-rs.github.io/unicode-segmentation/unicode_segmentation/trait.UnicodeSegmentation.html#tymethod.graphemes"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicode-segmentation</code></a></p>

<p>Now, Rust is a systems programming language and it just wouldn’t do to have expensive grapheme
segmentation operations all over your string defaults. I’m very happy that the expensive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code>
operations are all only possible with explicit acknowledgement of the cost. So I do think that going
the Swift route would be counterproductive for Rust. Not that it <em>can</em> anyway, due to backwards
compatibility :)</p>

<p>But I would prefer if the grapheme segmentation methods were in the stdlib (they used to be).
This is probably not something that will happen, though I should probably push for the unicode
crates being move into the nursery at least.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Rust is not a simple language. As with any such language, it has many little tidbits of complexity
that most folks aren’t aware of. Many of these tidbits are ones which may not practically matter
much for everyday Rust programming, but are interesting to know. Others may be more useful. I’ve
found that a lot of these aren’t documented anywhere (not that they always should be), and sometimes
depend on knowledge of compiler internals or history. As a fan of programming trivia myself, I’ve
decided to try writing about these things whenever I come across them. “Tribal Knowledge” shouldn’t
be a thing in a programming community; and trivia is fun!</em></p>

<p>Previously in tidbits: <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/01/10/rust-tidbits-box-is-special/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> is Special</a></p>

<p>Last time I talked about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and how it is a special snowflake. Corey <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5nb86x/rust_tidbits_box_is_special/dca4y6n/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=rust">asked</a> that
I write more about lang items, which are basically all of the special snowflakes in the stdlib.</p>

<p>So what <em>is</em> a lang item? Lang items are a way for the stdlib (and libcore) to define types, traits,
functions, and other items which the compiler needs to know about.</p>

<p>For example, when you write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x + y</code>, the compiler will effectively desugar that into
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add::add(x, y)</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. How did it know what trait to call? Did it just insert a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::core::Add::add</code> and hope the trait was defined there? This is what C++ does;
the Itanium ABI spec expects functions of certain names
to just <em>exist</em>, which the compiler is supposed to call in various cases. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard_*</code> functions from C++s deferred-initialization local statics (which
I’ve <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/06/26/adventures-in-systems-programming-c-plus-plus-local-statics/">explored in the past</a>) are an example of this. You’ll find that the spec is
full of similar <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa</code> functions. While the spec just expects certain types,
e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::type_traits</code> (“Type properties” § 20.10.4.3), to be magic and exist in certain locations,
the compilers seem to implement them using intrinsics like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__is_trivial&lt;T&gt;</code> which aren’t defined
in C++ code at all. So C++ compilers have a mix of solutions here, they partly insert calls
to known ABI functions, and they partly implement “special” types via intrinsics which
are detected and magicked when the compiler comes across them.</p>

<p>However, this is not Rust’s solution. It does not care what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add</code> trait is named or where it is
placed. Instead, it knew where the trait for addition was located because <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libcore/ops.rs#L243"><em>we told it</em></a>.
When you put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[lang = "add"]</code> on a trait, the compiler knows to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YourTrait::add(x, y)</code> when it
encounters the addition operator. Of course, usually the compiler will already have been told about
such a trait since libcore is usually the first library in the pipeline. If you want to actually use
this, you need to <em>replace libcore</em>.</p>

<p>Huh? You can’t do that, can you?</p>

<p>It’s not a big secret that you can compile rust without the stdlib using
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/no-stdlib.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#![no_std]</code></a>. This is useful in cases when you are on an embedded system and can’t
rely on an allocator existing. It’s also useful for writing your own alternate stdlib, though
that’s not something folks do often. Of course, libstd itself <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libstd/lib.rs#L213-L214">uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#![no_std]</code></a>,
because without it the compiler will happily inject an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern crate std</code> while trying to compile
libstd and the universe will implode.</p>

<p>What’s less known is that you can do the same thing with libcore, via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#![no_core]</code>. And, of course,
libcore <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libcore/lib.rs#L65">uses it</a> to avoid the cyclic dependency. Unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#![no_std]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no_core</code> is
a nightly-only feature that we may never stabilize<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#![no_core]</code> is something that’s basically
only to be used if you <em>are</em> libcore (or you are an alternate Rust stdlib/core implementation
trying to emulate it).</p>

<p>Still, it’s possible to write a working Rust binary in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no_core</code> mode:</p>

<p>If you run this, the program will exit with exit code 42.</p>

<p>Note that this already adds two lang items. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sized</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>. It’s usually worth
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libcore/marker.rs#L88-L94">looking at the lang item in libcore</a> and copying it over unless you want to make
tweaks. Beware that tweaks may not always work; not only does the compiler expect the lang item
to exist, it expects it to make sense. There are properties of the lang item that it assumes
are true, and failure to provide an appropriate lang item may cause the compiler to assert
without a useful error message. In this case I do have a tweak, since
the original definition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pub trait Copy: Clone {}</code>, but I know that this tweak
will work.</p>

<p>Lang items are usually only required when you do an operation which needs them. There are 72 non-
deprecated lang items and we only had to define three of them here. “start” is necessary to, well,
start executables, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sized</code> are very crucial to how the compiler reasons about types and
must exist.</p>

<p>But let’s try doing something that will trigger a lang item to be required:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u8</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust will immediately complain:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ rustc test.rs
error: requires `sync` lang_item
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because Rust wants to enforce that types in statics (which can be accessed concurrently)
are safe when accessed concurrently, i.e., they implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code>. We haven’t defined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> yet,
so Rust doesn’t know how to enforce this restruction. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> trait is defined with the “sync”
lang item, so we need to do:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u8</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nd">#[lang</span> <span class="nd">=</span> <span class="s">"sync"</span><span class="nd">]</span>
<span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="k">trait</span> <span class="nb">Sync</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="k">impl</span> <span class="nb">Sync</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">u8</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the trait doesn’t have to be called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> here, any trait name would work. This
definition is also a slight <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libcore/marker.rs#L343-L351">departure from the one in the stdlib</a>, and in general you
should include the auto trait impl (instead of specifically using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe impl Sync for u8 {}</code>)
since the compiler may assume it exists. Our code is small enough for this to not matter.</p>

<p>Alright, let’s try defining our own addition trait as before. First, let’s see
what happens if we try to add a struct when addition isn’t defined:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nd">#[lang</span> <span class="nd">=</span> <span class="s">"start"</span><span class="nd">]</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">start</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_main</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_argc</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">isize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_argv</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">isize</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Foo</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We get an error:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ rustc test.rs
error[E0369]: binary operation `+` cannot be applied to type `Foo`
  --&gt; test.rs:33:5
   |

   |
note: an implementation of `std::ops::Add` might be missing for `Foo`
  --&gt; test.rs:33:5
   |
33 |     Foo + Foo
   |     ^^^

error: aborting due to previous error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is interesting to note that here the compiler <em>did</em> refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add</code> by its path.
This is because the diagnostics in the compiler are free to assume that libcore
exists. However, the actual error just noted that it doesn’t know how to add two
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>s. But we can tell it how!</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[lang</span> <span class="nd">=</span> <span class="s">"add"</span><span class="nd">]</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will compile fine and the exit code of the program will be 42.</p>

<p>An interesting bit of behavior is what happens if we try to add two numbers. It will give us the
same kind of error, even though the addition of concrete primitives doesn’t
go through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add::add</code> (Rust asks LLVM to generate an add instruction directly). However, any addition operation still checks if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add::add</code> is implemented, even though it won’t get <em>used</em> in the case of a primitive. We can even verify this!</p>

<p>This will need to be compiled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-C opt-level=2</code>, since numeric addition in debug mode panics on
wrap and we haven’t defined the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"panic"</code> lang item to teach the compiler <em>how</em> to panic.</p>

<p>It will exit with 42, not 92, since while the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add</code> implementation is required for this to type
check, it doesn’t actually get used.</p>

<hr />

<p>So what lang items <em>are</em> there, and why are they lang items? There’s a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs#L252-L363">big list</a> in the
compiler. Let’s go through them:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs#L254-L272"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplItem</code> ones</a> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libstd_unicode/char.rs#L134-L135">core</a>) are used to mark implementations on
primitive types. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code> has some methods, and <em>someone</em> has to say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impl char</code> to define them. But
coherence only allows us to impl methods on types defined in our own crate, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code> isn’t defined
… in any crate, so how do we add methods to it? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[lang = "char"]</code> provides an escape hatch;
applying that to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impl char</code> will allow you to break the coherence rules and add methods,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libstd_unicode/char.rs#L134-L135">as is done in the standard library</a>. Since lang items can only be defined once, only
a single crate gets the honor of adding methods to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code>, so we don’t have any of the issues that
arise from sidestepping coherence.</p>

<p>There are a bunch for the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs#L274-L278">marker traits</a> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/408c2f7827be838aadcd05bd041dab94388af35d/src/libcore/marker.rs#L41-L356">core</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> is a lang item because you are allowed to use it in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> bound in a trait object (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;SomeTrait+Send+Sync&gt;</code>), and the compiler caches it aggressively</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> is a lang item for the same reasons as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>, but also because the compiler needs to enforce its implementation on types used in statics</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> is fundamental to classifying values and reasoning about moves/etc, so it needs to be a lang item</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sized</code> is also fundamental to reasoning about which values may exist on the stack. It is also magically included as a bound on generic parameters unless excluded with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?Sized</code></li>

certain optimizations. Specifically, Rust is allowed to reorder reads/writes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut foo</code> with the
assumption that the local variable holding the reference is the only alias allowed to read from
or write to the data, and it is allowed to reorder reads from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;foo</code> assuming that no other alias
writes to it. We tell LLVM that these types are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noalias</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code> turns this optimization
off, allowing writes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code> references. This is used in the implementation of interior
mutability types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

and can be specified with special syntax sugar, so they need to be lang items. They also

<p>We’ve already seen <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs#L340">the start lang item</a> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/libstd/rt.rs#L31-L67">std</a>) being used in our
minimal example program. This function is basically where you find Rust’s “runtime”: it gets called
with a pointer to main and the command line arguments, it sets up the “runtime”, calls main, and
tears down anything it needs to. Rust has a C-like minimal runtime, so
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/libstd/rt.rs#L31-L67">the actual libstd definition</a> doesn’t do much.
But you theoretically could stick a very heavy runtime initialization routine here.</p>

understand it, and apparently, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/408c2f7827be838aadcd05bd041dab94388af35d/src/libpanic_unwind/seh.rs#L232">neither does the person who wrote it</a>.</p>

the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> type. In my previous post I covered how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> is special; this lang item is how the
compiler finds impls on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> and knows what the type is. Unlike the other primitives, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> doesn’t
actually have a type name (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code>) that can be used if you’re writing libcore or libstd. This
lang item gives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> a type name that can be used to refer to it. (It also defines some,
but not all, of the semantics of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs#L348"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"phantom_data"</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libcore/marker.rs#L544-L546">core</a>) type itself is allowed to have
an unused type parameter, and it can be used to help fix the variance and drop behavior
of a generic type. More on this in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/phantom-data.html">the nomicon</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771/src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs#L360"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"non_zero"</code></a> lang item (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src/libcore/nonzero.rs#L38-L42">core</a>) marks the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NonZero&lt;T&gt;</code> type,
a type which is guaranteed to never contain a bit pattern of only zeroes. This is used inside things
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> – we know that the pointers in these can/should never be null, so they
contain a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NonZero&lt;*const T&gt;</code>. When used inside an enum like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, the discriminant
(the “tag” value that distinguishes between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Some</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>) is no longer necessary, since
we can mark the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> case as the case where the bits occupied by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NonZero</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Some</code> case
are zero. Beware, this optimization also applies to C-like enums that don’t have a variant
corresponding to a discriminant value of zero (unless they are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[repr(C)]</code>)</p>

<p>There are also a bunch of deprecated lang items there. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoCopy</code> used to be a struct
that could be dropped within a type to make it not implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>; in the past <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>
implementations were automatic like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> are today. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoCopy</code> was the way to opt out.
There also used to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoSend</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoSync</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CovariantType</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CovariantLifetime</code>/etc were the
predecessors of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData</code>; they could be used to specify variance relations of a type with its
type or lifetime parameters, but you can now do this with providing the right <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData</code>, e.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InvariantType&lt;T&gt;</code> is now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>.
The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html">nomicon</a> has more on variance. I don’t know why these lang items haven’t been
removed (they don’t work anymore anyway); the only consumer of them is libcore so “deprecating” them
seems unnecessary. It’s probably an oversight.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iterator</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntoIterator</code> are <em>not</em> lang items, even though they are used in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code>
loops. Instead, the compiler inserts hardcoded calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::std::iter::Iterator::next</code>, and a hardcoded reference to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::std::option::Option</code> (The paths use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no_std</code> mode). This is probably because the compiler desugars <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops before type
resolution is done, so withut this, libcore would not be able to use for loops since the compiler
wouldn’t know what calls to insert in place of the loops while compiling.</p>

<hr />

<p>Basically, whenever the compiler needs to use special treatment with an item – whether it be
dispatching calls to functions and trait methods in various situations, conferring special semantics
to types/traits, or requiring traits to be implemented, the type will be defined in the standard
library (libstd, libcore, or one of the crates behind the libstd façade), and marked as a lang item.</p>

<p>Some of the lang items are useful/necessary when working without libstd. Most only come into play if
you want to replace libcore, which is a pretty niche thing to do, and knowing about them is rarely
useful outside of the realm of compiler hacking.</p>

<p>But, like with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> madness, I still find this quite interesting, even if it isn’t generally
useful!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rust is not a simple language. As with any such language, it has many little tidbits of complexity
that most folks aren’t aware of. Many of these tidbits are ones which may not practically matter
much for everyday Rust programming, but are interesting to know. Others may be more useful. I’ve
found that a lot of these aren’t documented anywhere (not that they always should be), and sometimes
depend on knowledge of compiler internals or history. As a fan of programming trivia myself, I’ve
decided to try writing about these things whenever I come across them. “Tribal Knowledge” shouldn’t
be a thing in a programming community; and trivia is fun!</p>

<hr />

<p>So. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>. Your favorite heap allocation type that nobody uses<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I was discussing some stuff on the rfcs repo when
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1850#issuecomment-271766300">@burdges realized that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> has a funky <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref</code> impl</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e4fee525e04838dabc82beed5ae1a06051be53fd/src/liballoc/boxed.rs#L502">look at it</a>:</p>

<p>Wait, what? <em>Squints</em></p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">deref</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>The call is coming from inside the house!</em></p>

<p>In case you didn’t realize it, this deref impl returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;**self</code> – since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>
is an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, dereferencing it once will provide a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, and the second dereference
will dereference the box to provide a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>. We then wrap it in a reference and return it.</p>

<p>But wait, we are <em>defining</em> how a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is to be dereferenced (that’s what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref::deref</code> is
for!), such a definition cannot itself dereference a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>! That’s infinite recursion.</p>

<p>And indeed. For any other type such a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deref</code> impl would recurse infinitely. If you run
<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=9c8a02336c6816e57c83de39c103ca06&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">this code</a>:</p>

        <span class="o">&amp;**</span><span class="k">self</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the compiler will warn you:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>warning: function cannot return without recurring, #[warn(unconditional_recursion)] on by default
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:7:5
  |
7 |     fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {

8 |         &amp;**self
  |          ^^^^^^
  = help: a `loop` may express intention better if this is on purpose
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually trying to dereference the type will lead to a stack overflow.</p>

<p>Clearly something is fishy here. This deref impl is similar to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/52c03d1d619fd25c961bc9de59bcc942b660d5db/src/libcore/ops.rs#L2460">the deref impl for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code></a>,
or the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/52c03d1d619fd25c961bc9de59bcc942b660d5db/src/libcore/ops.rs#L263"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add</code> impl for number types</a>, or any other of the implementations of operators on
primitive types. For example we literally
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/52c03d1d619fd25c961bc9de59bcc942b660d5db/src/libcore/ops.rs#L263">define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add</code> on two integers to be their addition</a>. The reason these impls need to exist
is so that people can still call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add::add</code> if they need to in generic code and be able to pass
integers to things with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add</code> bound. But the compiler knows how to use builtin operators on
numbers and dereference borrowed references without these impls. But those are primitive types
which are defined in the compiler, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is just a regular smart pointer struct, right?</p>

<p>Turns out, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is special. It, too, is somewhat of a primitive type.</p>

<p>This is partly due to historical accident.</p>

<p>To understand this, we must look back to Ye Olde days of pre-1.0 Rust (ca 2014). Back in these days,
we had none of this newfangled “stability” business. The compiler broke your code every two weeks.
Of course, you wouldn’t <em>know</em> that because the compiler would usually crash before it could tell
you that your code was broken! Sigils roamed the lands freely, and cargo was but a newborn child
which was destined to eventually end the tyranny of Makefiles. People were largely happy knowing
that their closures were safely boxed and their threads sufficiently green.</p>

<p>Back in these days, we didn’t have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>. We had <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~[T]</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~str</code>.
The second two are <em>not</em> equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;[T]&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;str&gt;</code>, even though they may look like it,
they are both growable containers like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> conceptually meant “owned”, though
IMO that caused more confusion than it was worth.</p>

<p>You created a box using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> operator, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let x = ~1;</code>. It could be dereferenced with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>
operator, and autoderef worked much like it does today.</p>

<p>As a “primitive” type; like all primitive types, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code> was special. The compiler knew things about
it. The compiler knew how to dereference it without an explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref</code> impl. In fact, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref</code>
traits <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/12491">came into existence</a> much after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code> did. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code> never got an explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref</code> impl,
though it probably should have.</p>

<p>Eventually, there was a move to remove sigils from the language. The box constructor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~foo</code> was
superseded by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/11055/">placement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">box</code> syntax</a>, which still exists in Rust nightly<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Then, the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/13904"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code> type became <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~[T]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~str</code> would also be removed, though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~str</code> took
a very confusing detour with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StrBuf</code> first).</p>

<p>However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> was still special. It no longer needed special syntax to be referred to or
constructed, but it was still internally a special type. It didn’t even have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref</code> impl yet,
that came <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/20052">six months later</a>, and it was implemented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;**self</code>, exactly the same
as it is today.</p>

<p>But why does it <em>have</em> to be special now? Rust had all the features it needed (allocations,
ownership, overloadable deref) to implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> in pure rust in the stdlib as if it
were a regular type.</p>

<p>Turns out that Rust didn’t. You see, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and before it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code> were special, their
dereference semantics were implemented in a different part of the code. And, these semantics were
not the same as the ones for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefImm</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMut</code>, which were created for use with other smart
pointers. I don’t know if the possibility of being used for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~T</code> was considered when
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefImm</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMut</code> were being implemented, or if it was a simple oversight, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> has
three pieces of behavior that could not be replicated in pure Rust at the time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">box foo</code> in a pattern would destructure a box into its contents. It’s somewhat the opposite of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">box foo()</code> performed placement box, so the result of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo()</code> could be directly written to a preallocated box, reducing extraneous copies</li>
  <li>You could <em>move out of deref</em> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The third one is the one that really gets to us here<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.
For a <em>regular</em> type, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*foo</code> will produce a temporary that must be immediately borrowed or copied.
You cannot do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let x = *y</code> for a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> type. This dereference operation will call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMut::deref_mut</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deref::deref</code> based on how it gets borrowed. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, you can do
this:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Box</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// moves the vec out into `y`, then deallocates the box</span>
            <span class="c1">// but does not call a destructor on the vec</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For any other type, such an operation will produce a “cannot move out of a borrow” error.</p>

<p>This operation is colloquially called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMove</code>, and there has been <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/178/files?short_path=6f69a99#diff-6f69a990502a98c2eeb172d87269005d">an rfc</a> in the
past for making it into a trait. I suspect that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMove</code> semantics could even have been
removed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> before 1.0 (I don’t find it <em>necessary</em>), but people had better things to do,
like fixing the million other rough edges of the language that can’t be touched after backwards
compatibility is a thing.</p>

<p>So now we’re stuck with it. The current status is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is <em>still</em> a special type in the
compiler. By “special type” I don’t just mean that the compiler treats it a bit differently (this is
true for any lang item), I mean that it literally is treated as
<a href="http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/rustc/ty/enum.TypeVariants.html#TyBox.v">a completely new kind of type</a>, not as a struct the way it has been defined in liballoc.
There’s a TON of cruft in the compiler related to this type, much of which can be removed, but some
of which can’t. If we ever do get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMove</code>, we should probably try removing it all again. After
writing this post I’m half-convinced to try and implement an internal-use-only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMove</code> and try
cleaning up the code myself.</p>

<p>Most of this isn’t really useful to know unless you actually come across a case where you can make
use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMove</code> semantics, or if you work on the compiler. But it certainly is interesting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Rust compiler is written in Rust. This is overall a pretty common practice in compiler
development. This usually means that the process of building the compiler involves downloading a
(typically) older version of the compiler.</p>

<p>This also means that the compiler is vulnerable to what is colloquially known as the “Trusting
Trust” attack, an attack described in <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf">Ken Thompson’s acceptance speech for the 1983 Turing Award</a>.
This kind of thing fascinates me, so I decided to try writing one myself. It’s stuff like this which
started my interest in compilers, and I hope this post can help get others interested the same way.</p>

<p>To be clear, this isn’t an indictment of Rust’s security. Quite a few languages out there have
popular self-hosted compilers (C, C++, Haskell, Scala, D, Go) and are vulnerable to this attack. For
this attack to have any effect, one needs to be able to uniformly distribute this compiler, and
there are roughly equivalent ways of doing the same level of damage with that kind of access.</p>

<p>If you already know what a trusting trust attack is, you can skip the next section. If you just want
to see the code, it’s in the <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/tree/rusting-trust">trusting-trust branch</a> on my Rust fork, specifically
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/blob/rusting-trust/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L541">this code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-attack">The attack</h2>

<p>The essence of the attack is this:</p>

<p>An attacker can conceivably change a compiler such that it can detect a particular kind of application and
make malicious changes to it. The example given in the talk was the UNIX <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login</code> program — the attacker
can tweak a compiler so as to detect that it is compiling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login</code> program, and compile in a
backdoor that lets it unconditionally accept a special password (created by the attacker) for any
user, thereby giving the attacker access to all accounts on all systems that have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login</code> compiled
by their modified compiler.</p>

<p>However, this change would be detected in the source. If it was not included in the source, this
change would disappear in the next release of the compiler, or when someone else compiles the
compiler from source. Avoiding this attack is easily done by compiling your own compilers and not
downloading untrusted binaries. This is good advice in general regarding untrusted binaries, and it
equally applies here.</p>

<p>To counter this, the attacker can go one step further. If they can tweak the compiler so as to
backdoor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login</code>, they could also tweak the compiler so as to backdoor itself. The attacker needs to
modify the compiler with a backdoor which detects when it is compiling the same compiler, and
introduces <em>itself</em> into the compiler that it is compiling. On top of this it can also introduce
backdoors into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login</code> or whatever other program the attacker is interested in.</p>

<p>Now, in this case, even if the backdoor is removed from the source, <em>every compiler compiled using
this backdoored compiler will be similarly backdoored</em>. So if this backdoored compiler somehow
starts getting distributed, it will spread itself as it is used to compile more copies of itself
(e.g. newer versions, etc). And it will be virtually undetectable — since the source doesn’t
need to be modified for it to work; just the non-human-readable binary.</p>

<p>Of course, there are ways to protect against this. Ultimately, before a compiler for language X
existed, that compiler had to be written in some other language Y. If you can track the sources back
to that point you can bootstrap a working compiler from scratch and keep compiling newer compiler
versions till you reach the present. This raises the question of whether or not Y’s compiler is
backdoored. While it sounds pretty unlikely that such a backdoor could be so robust as to work on
two different compilers and stay put throughout the history of X, you can of course trace back Y
back to other languages and so on till you find a compiler in assembly that you can verify<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="backdooring-rust">Backdooring Rust</h2>

<p>Alright, so I want to backdoor my compiler. I first have to decide when in the pipeline the code
that insert backdoors executes. The Rust compiler operates by taking source code, parsing it into a
syntax tree (AST), transforming it into some intermediate representations (HIR and MIR), and feeding
it to LLVM in the form of LLVM IR, after which LLVM does its thing and creates binaries. A backdoor
can be inserted at any point in this stage. To me, it seems like it’s easier to insert one into the
AST, because it’s easier to obtain AST from source, and this is important as we’ll see soon. It also
makes this attack less practically viable<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is nice since this is just a fun exercise and I
don’t actually want to backdoor the compiler.</p>

<p>So the moment the compiler finishes parsing, my code will modify the AST to insert a backdoor.</p>

<p>First, I’ll try to write a simpler backdoor; one which doesn’t affect the compiler but instead
affects some programs. I shall write a backdoor that replaces occurrences of the string “hello world”
with “जगाला नमस्कार”, a rough translation of the same in my native language.</p>

<p>Now, in rustc, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rustc_driver</code> crate is where the whole process of compiling is coordinated. In particular,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1cabe2151299c63497abc3a20bd08c04c0cd32a3/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L546"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase_2_configure_and_expand</code></a> is run right after parsing (which is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1cabe2151299c63497abc3a20bd08c04c0cd32a3/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L485">phase 1</a>). Perfect.
Within that function, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">krate</code> variable contains the parsed AST for the crate<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and we need to modify that.</p>

<p>In this case, there’s already machinery in <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/syntax/fold/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syntax::fold</code></a> for mutating ASTs based on patterns. A
<a href="http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/syntax/fold/trait.Folder.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Folder</code></a> basically has the ability to walk the AST, producing a mirror AST, with modifications. For
each kind of node, you get to specify a function which will produce a node to be used in its place.
Most such functions will default to no-op (returning the same node).</p>

<p>So I write the following <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Folder</code>:</p>

This is because our backdoor isn’t perfect; it applies to the <em>pre-expansion</em> AST. In this AST,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">println!</code> is stored as a macro and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"hello world"</code> is part of the macro token tree; and has not
yet been turned into an expression. Our folder ignores it. It is not too hard to perform this same attack
post-expansion, however.</p>

<p>So far, so good. We have a compiler that tweaks “hello world” strings. Now, let’s see if we can get
it to miscompile itself. This means that our compiler, when compiling a pristine Rust source tree,
should produce a compiler that is similarly backdoored (with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust</code> module and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust::fold_crate()</code> call).</p>

<p>We need to tweak our folder so that it does two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inserts the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let krate = trust::fold_crate(krate);</code> statement in the appropriate function (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase_2_configure_and_expand</code>) when compiling a pristine Rust source tree</li>
  <li>Inserts the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust</code> module</li>
</ul>

<p>The former is relatively easy. We need to construct an AST for that statement (can be done by
invoking the parser again and extracting the node). The latter is where it gets tricky. We can
encode instructions for outputting the AST of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust</code> module, but these instructions themselves
are within the same module, so the instructions for outputting <em>these</em> instructions need to be
included, and so on. This clearly isn’t viable.</p>

<p>However, there’s a way around this. It’s a common trick used in writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">quines</a>, which face similar
issues. The idea is to put the entire block of code in a string. We then construct the code for the
module by doing something like</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">mod</span> <span class="n">trust</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>So you have a string containing the contents of the module, except for itself. You build the code
for the module by using the string twice – once to construct the code for the declaration of the
string, and once to construct the code for the rest of the module. Now, by parsing this, you’ll get
the original AST!</p>

<p>Let’s try this step by step. Let’s first see if injecting an arbitrary string (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use foo::bar::blah</code>)
works, without worrying about this cyclical quineyness:</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>s let us specify “raw strings” in Rust, where I can freely include other quotation marks
without needing to escape things. For a string starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> pound symbols, we can have raw
strings with up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n - 1</code> pound symbols inside it. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELF_STRING</code> is declared with four pound
symbols, and the code in the trust module only uses raw strings with three pound symbols. Since the
code needs to generate the declaration of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELF_STRING</code> (with four pound symbols), we manually
concatenate extra pound symbols on – a 4-pound-symbol raw string will not be valid within a three-
pound-symbol raw string since the parser will try to end the string early. So we don’t ever directly
type a sequence of four consecutive pound symbols in the code, and instead construct it by
concatenating two pairs of pound symbols.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code_for_module</code> declaration really does the same as:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">code_for_module</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"mod trust { static SELF_STRING: &amp;'static str = </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s">"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">SELF_STRING</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s">;"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">SELF_STRING</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"}"</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>conceptually, but also ensures that things stay escaped. I could get similar results by calling into
a function that takes a string and inserts literal backslashes at the appropriate points.</p>

<p>To update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELF_STRING</code>, we just need to include all the code inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust</code> module after the
declaration of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELF_STRING</code> itself inside the string. I won’t include this inline since it’s big,
but <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/blob/rusting-trust/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L541">this is what it looks like in the end</a>.</p>

<p>If we try compiling this code to stage 2 after updating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELF_STRING</code>, we will get errors about
duplicate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust</code> modules, which makes sense because we’re actually already compiling an already-
backdoored version of the Rust source code. While we could set up two Rust builds, the easiest way
to verify if our attack is working is to just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[cfg(stage0)]</code> on the trust module and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fold_crate</code> call<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. These will only get included during “stage 0” (when it compiles the stage 1
compiler<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>), and not when it compiles the stage 2 compiler, so if the stage 2 compiler still
backdoors executables, we’re done.</p>

<p>On building the stage 2 (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make rustc-stage2</code>) compiler,</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>rustup run stage2 rustc test.rs
<span class="nv">$ </span>./test
जगाला नमस्कार
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was also able to make it work with a separate clone of Rust:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> /path/to/new/clone
<span class="c"># Tell rustup to use our backdoored stage1 compiler whenever rustc is invoked</span>
<span class="c"># from anywhere inside this folder.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>rustup override <span class="nb">set </span>stage1 <span class="c"># Works with stage 2 as well.</span>

<span class="c"># with --enable-local-rust, instead of the downloaded stage 0 compiler compiling</span>
<span class="c"># stage 0 internal libraries (like libsyntax), the libraries from the local Rust get used. Hence we</span>
<span class="c"># need to check out a git commit close to our changes. This commit is the parent of our changes,</span>
<span class="c"># and is bound to work</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout bfa709a38a8c607e1c13ee5635fbfd1940eb18b1

<span class="c"># This will make it call `rustc` instead of downloading its own compiler.</span>
<span class="c"># We already overrode rustc to be our backdoored compiler for this folder</span>
<span class="c"># using rustup</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>./configure <span class="nt">--enable-local-rust</span>
<span class="c"># build it!</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>make rustc-stage1
<span class="c"># Tell rustup about the new toolchain</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>rustup toolchain <span class="nb">link </span>other-stage1 /path/to/new/clone/target_dir/stage1
<span class="nv">$ </span>rustup run other-stage1 rustc test.rs
<span class="nv">$ </span>./test
जगाला नमस्कार
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, a pristine copy of the rustc source has built a compiler infected with the backdoor.</p>

<hr />

<p>So we now have a working trusting trust attack in Rust. What can we do with it? Hopefully nothing!
This particular attack isn’t very robust, and while that can be improved upon, building a practical
and resilient trusting trust attack that won’t get noticed is a bit trickier.</p>

<p>We in the Rust community should be working on ways to prevent such attacks from being successful, though.</p>

<p>A couple of things we could do are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work on an alternate Rust compiler (in Rust or otherwise). For a pair of self-hosted compilers, there’s a technique called <a href="http://www.acsa-admin.org/countering-trusting-trust-through-diverse-double-compiling/">“Diverse Double-Compiling”</a> wherein you choose an arbitrary sequence of compilers (something like “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> followed by 3x <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang</code> followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code>” followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang</code>), and compile each compiler with the output of the previous one. Difficulty of writing a backdoor that can survive this process grows exponentially.</li>
  <li>Try compiling rustc from its ocaml roots, and package up the process into a shell script so that you have reproducible trustworthy rustc builds.</li>
  <li>Make rustc builds deterministic, which means that a known-trustworthy rustc build can be compared against a suspect one to figure out if it has been tampered with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall trusting trust attacks aren’t that pressing a concern since there are many other ways to get
approximately equivalent access with the same threat model. Having the ability to insert any
backdoor into distributed binaries is bad enough, and should be protected against regardless of
whether or not the backdoor is a self-propagating one. If someone had access to the distribution or
build servers, for example, they could as easily insert a backdoor into the <em>server</em>, or place a key
so that they can reupload tampered binaries when they want. Now, cleaning up after these attacks is
easier than trusting trust, but ultimately this is like comparing being at the epicenter of Little
Boy or the Tsar Bomba – one is worse, but you’re atomized regardless, and your mitigation plan
shouldn’t need to change.</p>

<p>But it’s certainly an interesting attack, and should be something we should at least be thinking
about.</p>

      <p>Of course, <em>this</em> raises the question of whether or not your assembler/OS/loader/processor is backdoored. Ultimately, you have to trust <em>someone</em>, which was partly the point of Thompson’s talk. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently we (<a href="http://github.com/pnkfelix/">Felix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">Niko</a>, and I) have been working on getting compiler-level GC
support for Rust. The plan is to provide a base set of APIs and intrinsics on which GCs can be
built, without including an actual GC itself. This blog post serves as status update and a pre-pre-
rfc on the designs. I’m also going to walk through the process of coming up with the current design.
We’ll soon be posting more detailed design docs and discussion about some of the unresolved bits.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this is the same as <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/designing-a-gc-in-rust/">my motivation for writing rust-gc</a>. Firstly,
it makes it possible to integrate with languages which themselves have a GC. Being able to safely
pass around GCd types in Rust is very useful when writing libraries for Node, Python, or Ruby in
Rust.</p>

<p>Secondly, some algorithms are much neater when a GC is involved. Things like persistent
datastructures, for example, are easier to deal with when a GC is involved.
<a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2015/08/27/epoch/">There are ways around this requirement</a>, but it’s nice to have the full range of
options.</p>

<p>Rust tries to be safe without a GC, and this doesn’t change that — we envision that GCs
in Rust will be rarely used except for some very specific use cases like the ones listed above.</p>

<p>Compiler support isn’t strictly necessary for a GC in Rust to be safe. <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc">rust-gc</a> manages to work
without compiler support (except for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[derive()]</code> plugin). However, there’s a lot of manual
tracking of roots involved, which has a much higher cost than compiler-backed GCs. This is
suboptimal — we want GC support to be as efficient as possible.</p>

<h2 id="design-goals">Design goals</h2>

<p>We’re considering GCs designed as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> object, which, like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, can be explicitly
wrapped around a value to move it to the GC heap. A pervasive GC (where every Rust object is GCd) is
an explicit non-goal; if you need a GC <em>everywhere</em> a different language may make more sense. We’re
expecting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> to be used only where needed, much like how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is today.</p>

<p>We want this to work well with other Rust abstractions. Things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;Gc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> should be
completely legal, for example.</p>

<p>We want implementors to have total freedom in how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> is represented – <em>they</em> define the type,
not the compiler. The compiler provides traits and intrinsics which can be used to find the GC
roots. It should be possible for implementors to provide safe APIs for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>. There will be no
canonical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> in the stdlib.</p>

<p>We are trying to support multiple GCs in a single binary. This should be a pretty niche thing to
need, but it strengthens the behavior of GCs as libraries (and not magical one-time things like
custom allocators). One possible use case for this is if a library internally uses a GC to run some
algorithm, and this library is used by an application which uses a GC for some other reason (perhaps
to talk to Node). Interacting GCs are hard to reason about, though. The current design leaves this
decision up to the GC designer — while it is possible to let your GCd object contain objects
managed by a different GC, this requires some explicit extra work. Interacting GCs is a <em>very</em> niche
use case<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, so if this ability isn’t something we’re adamant on supporting.</p>

<p>We also would like it to be safe to use trait objects with the GC. This raises some concerns which
I’ll address in depth later in this post.</p>

<h2 id="core-design">Core design</h2>

<p>The core idea is to use <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/StackMaps.html">LLVM stack maps</a> to keep track of roots.</p>

<p>In a tracing GC, the concept of a “root” is basically something which can be directly reached
without going through other GC objects. In our case they will be cases of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> ending up on the
stack or in non-gc heap boxes which themselves are reachable from the stack. Some examples:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Bar</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">bool</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>When figuring out which objects are live (“tracing”), we need to have this initial set of “roots”
which contain the list of things directly reachable from the stack. From here, the GC can rifle
through the fields and subfields of the roots till it finds other GCd objects, which it can mark as
live and continue the process with.</p>

<p>Most runtimes for GCd languages have efficient ways of obtaining this list of roots. Contrast this
with conservative collectors like Boehm, which read in the whole stack and consider anything which
looks like a pointer to the GC heap to be a root. rust-gc’s approach is inefficient too; because it
incurs an additional reference counting cost on copying and mutation.</p>

<p>However, the list of current roots is known at compile time; it’s just a matter of which variables
are live at any point. We store this list of live variables in a per-call-site “stack map”. To find
all the roots, you walk up the call stack, and for each call site look up its entry in the stack
map, which will contain the stack offsets of all the roots (and other metadata if we need it). LLVM
has native support for this. The stack map is stored in a separate section so there is no runtime
performance hit during regular execution, however some optimizations may be inhibited by turning on
GC.</p>

<p>So basically a GC will have access to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">walk_roots&lt;F&gt;(f: F) where F: FnMut(..)</code> intrinsic that will
yield all the roots to the provided function (which can then mark them as such and start tracing).</p>

<p>I’m not going to focus on the implementation of this intrinsic for this blog post — this might
be the subject of a later blog post by <a href="http://github.com/pnkfelix/">Felix</a> who is working on this.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m focusing on the higher-level API.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-rootables">Identifying rootables</h2>

<p>The first problem we come across with the design mentioned above is that the compiler doesn’t yet
know how to distinguish between a root and a non-root. We can’t mark <em>every</em> variable as a root;
that would bloat the stack maps and make walking the roots a very expensive operation.</p>

<p>A very simple way of doing this is via a trait, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>.</p>

<p>if we detect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> objects that are directly reachable, we consider them to be roots.</p>

<p>This has a flaw, it doesn’t actually tell us how to find roots inside container types. What would we
do if there was a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;Gc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;Gc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> on the stack? We can stick their entry in the stack
map, but the GC needs to know what to do with them!</p>

<p>We could store some type information in the map and let the GC hardcode how to root each container
type. This isn’t extensible though; the GC will have to be able to handle types from arbitrary
crates too. Additionally, we have to solve this problem anyway for tracing — when tracing we
need to be able to find all values “contained” within a particular value, which is the same
operation we need to do to find roots.</p>

<p>For this purpose, we introduce the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait:</p>

<p>(These traits are unsafe to implement because an incorrect implementation can lead to a
reachable value getting cleaned up by the GC, which is unsafe)</p>

<p>Basically, an implementation of Trace will yield all values owned by the object, unless that object
is a GC struct like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>, in which case the GC implementor will have it mark the object. This
way, calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.trace()</code> will walk all fields and subfields of an object recursively, until it finds
all of the contained <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s.</p>

<p>This has an issue with multiple GCs, though — we don’t want the GCs to interact unless they
want to, and with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait being shared one GC object may accidentally contain a different
GC object.</p>

<p>We need to introduce the concept of a tracer here.</p>

<p>This also makes it easier to distinguish between rooting and tracing operations. While the
operations are similar (“to root/trace a value, walk its fields recursively till you find all of the
Gc<T>s, and root/mark *those*"), the code we run at the leaf `Gc<T>` nodes is different. In the
previous model, this could have been solved with a global static boolean that identifies if the code
is currently walking roots or tracing, but with the `Tracer` trait object we can just pass in
different tracer values.</T></T></p>

<p>We’re not yet sure if we should be lumping root walking and tracing in a single trait; so we might
end up with a second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scan</code> trait that works similarly.</p>

<p>Note that we’re not getting rid of the Root trait here. This is because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> have
slightly incompatible purposes – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> signals to the compiler if something definitely contains
roots, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> marks things which are safe to put inside a GC. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>, but not
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;Gc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;bool&gt;</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> but not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code>
are neither. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> will actually show up in trait bounds for GC code. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> will only be analysed
by the compiler itself, bounds like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R: Root</code> probably won’t show up.</p>

<p>There should not be any types which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> but not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>, because this means the compiler
won’t know what to do with them!</p>

<p>Now, when generating the stack map, we include the stack offset of all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> objects in scope, as
well as appropriate dynamic dispatch vtable pointers for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> implementation<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Walking the
stack involves calling the trace method on each entry in the stack map for each call site.</p>

<h2 id="unresolved-problems">Unresolved problems</h2>

<p>There are a lot of these. Suggestions very welcome.</p>

<h3 id="trait-objects">Trait objects</h3>

<p>Trait objects provide an interesting challenge. They may or may not contain roots, but what’s more
important is that trait objects in libraries that know nothing about GC may also contain roots.</p>

<p>For example, if a library is dealing with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;SomeTrait&gt;</code>, and your code feeds it a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;SomeRoot as SomeTrait&gt;</code>, the trait object is now a root. If a gc is triggered while in
this call (perhaps by a callback), then this trait object should be counted as a root.</p>

<p>But this library didn’t depend on the GC, and when it was compiled, it wasn’t compiled with stack
map entries for this GC object.</p>

<p>There are two solutions here. The first is to recompile everything (including libstd) from scratch
with GC support on, and put all owned trait objects in the stack maps. They will have an extra
generated trace entry in the vtable that will ignore the object if it isn’t a root. To put trait
objects inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>, you will have to explicitly use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;Trait+Trace&gt;</code>, however – this magical
trace entry is just for collecting roots.</p>

<p>The second solution is to simply not allow casting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> objects to owned trait objects. I feel
that there are use cases for both – the former has extra bloat and requires a custom libstd (which
could be distributed via rustup if necessary), but the latter restricts how you use trait objects.
Servo, for example, would probably prefer the latter since we don’t put our DOM objects in owned
trait objects. But other GC users may want maximum flexibility. Letting people choose this via a
codegen flag (which can be controlled via cargo) might be a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="should-it-be-tracet">Should it be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p>There is a dynamic dispatch cost on rooting/tracing any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> leaf with the tracer model.</p>

<p>This can be obviated by having it be:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">trait</span> <span class="n">Trace</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Tracer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">trace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tracer</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most types would implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;T&gt;</code>, and GCs can implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;SpecificTracer&gt;</code>,
and only require their contents to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;SpecificTracer&gt;</code>. This lets the type system
forbid interacting GCs instead of having it done at runtime.</p>

<p>This has multiple downsides, however:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[derive(Trace)]</code> becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[derive(Trace&lt;MyTracer&gt;)]</code> for things containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> (because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;T&gt;</code> for all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, and macro expansion runs before this information can be computed).</li>
  <li>If there are multiple GCs, there are multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;T&gt;</code> vtable pointers in the stack map. Not all libs know about the other GC when being compiled, so you need to defer generation of these stack map entries somehow.</li>
  <li>The heuristics for forbidding types which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> but not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;T&gt;</code> become subtler. You have to effectively forbid types which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> but do not have an impl of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace&lt;T&gt;</code> for at least one tracer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> that is active in the compilation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-trace-collections-on-the-stack">Non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> collections on the stack</h3>

<p>If something like the following, defined by a third-party library:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>doesn’t implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>, it’s still okay to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo&lt;RootedThing&gt;</code> on the stack, because we can
figure out that the inner <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is what we need to root.</p>

<p>However, if a third-party <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyVec&lt;T&gt;</code> (which behaves like a vector) contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RootedThing</code>s, and is
on the stack, the compiler doesn’t know what do do with it. Lack of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> bound makes it
impossible to put such types on the GC heap, but there’s no restriction on putting these types on
the stack. As I mentioned before, we can simply forbid the existence of types which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> but
not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyVec&lt;RootedThing&gt;</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>). This is already done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code>.</p>

<p>There’s a subtle difference between this and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> forbidding. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> are
always explicitly implemented. On the other hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> is an auto trait and automatically
implements itself on types containing roots. This means that we can’t necessarily forbid such types
being created at impl time — third party collections like above for example won’t contain
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> types until they are monomorphised. We can error during monomorphization, but this error
might not be very user-friendly, like template errors in C++.</p>

<p>Another solution is to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?Root</code>, much like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?Sized</code>. This means that the writers of
collections will explicitly opt in to allowing GCd things inside them. This probably would lead to a
lot more churn, however. But the diagnostics would be clearer.</p>

<p>Turns out that
<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=ad485dc2fc91e5c1aad53051dc207716&amp;version=nightly&amp;backtrace=0">this</a>
actually works with half-decent diagnostics. This doesn’t forbid the existence of types which impl
Root but not Trace, however. It simply avoids autoderiving Root on types which aren’t Trace. But
this behavior can be changed.
(In fact, it <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35745">was changed</a> while this post was being written!)</p>

<p>It becomes more complicated with Trace<T> though.
Having `Root<T>` might fix this, but then you have to deal with the auto trait generics.</T></T></p>

<p>One solution for the auto trait generics is to simple not include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> in the stdlib. Instead,
require code like the following:</p>

<p>This can be further simplified by completely removing the rooting trait requirement and instead
require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[gc(tracer=MyTracer)]</code> on all GC structs. This, however, is a bit more special and we lose
the free diagnostics that you get from utilizing the type system.</p>

<h3 id="are-root-containing-raw-pointers-root">Are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>-containing raw pointers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>?</h3>

<p>For the auto-trait to work, types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;ContainsRoot&gt;</code> should also be marked as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>.</p>

<p>This can be done by just marking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*const T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*mut T</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> using an impl in
libcore. However, borrowed types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iter</code> will also be dragged into this. We only want types
which <em>own</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> things to be considered roots.</p>

<p>The alternative is to not require this, and solely rely on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/phantom-data.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData</code></a>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> also
contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData&lt;T&gt;</code>, which gives the compiler a hint that it owns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>. On the other hand,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iter&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a T&gt;</code>, which hints that it borrows a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>. This is already
used by the compiler to determine drop soundness, so we can just use the same thing to determine
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> types. This is already supported by the autotrait infrastructure.</p>

<p>A downside here is that we’re relying more on producers of unsafe code remembering to use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData</code>. I’m not 100% certain about this, but triggering dropck unsoundness by neglecting
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData</code> is still pretty hard (and often requires types like arenas), whereas forgetting a root
can very easily cause a GC segfault. I do not consider this to be a major downside.</p>

<h3 id="finalizers-and-drop">Finalizers and Drop</h3>

<p>The following code is unsafe:</p>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// Foo itself is used as a `Gc&lt;Foo&gt;`</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that destructors run in the sweep cycle of a GC, in some order. This means that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code>
may have already been collected when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>’s destructor runs. While in many cases this can be solved
with a smart collection alrogithm, in the case where there’s a cycle being collected there’s nowhere
safe to start.</p>

<p>Additionally, further mutation of the graph after collection may extend the lifetime of a to-be-
collected variable.</p>

<p>A simple solution is to forbid all GC accesses during the collection phase. However, this means
dereferences too, and this will incur a cost on all GCd types – they stop being simple pointer
accesses. This solution places the burden on the GC implementor, instead of the compiler.</p>

<p>We have enough information in the type system to solve this – we can forbid <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> impls on types
which are explicitly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code>. But it turns out that this isn’t enough. Consider:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo&lt;Bar&gt;</code> now has an unsafe destructor. Stopping this behavior requres forbidding Drop impls on
structs with trait bounds, but that is too restrictive.</p>

<p>This may end up having a similar solution to the “all roots must be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>” issue. Warning on
monomorphizations isn’t enough, we need to be able to allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;ContainsRoot&gt;</code>, but not
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HijackableType&lt;ContainsRoot&gt;</code>. Making this distinction without poisoning half the generics out
there is tricky.</p>

<p>The notion of a hijackable type is actually already important for sound generic drop impls, see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1327-dropck-param-eyepatch.md">RFC 1327 (dropck eyepatch)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1238-nonparametric-dropck.md">RFC 1238 (nonparametrick dropck)</a>,
and their predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0769-sound-generic-drop.md">RFC 0769 (sound generic drop)</a>. We might be able to rely
on this, but would need to introduce additional constraints in dropck.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is always the fallback solution of requiring the implementor to enforce this
constraint at runtime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the reasons I like cryptography is that it’s a gold mine of interesting problems which feel
like they are impossible to solve and if a solution exists, it must be magic.</p>

<p>The other day, I came across one such problem <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/763060674956173314">here</a>, by @SarahJamieLewis</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a scheme where A can give reputation points to B, &amp; later, B presenting as C can prove
their reputation (without revealing A or B)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I recommend trying to solve this yourself before reading ahead)</p>

<p>The problem isn’t completely defined because we don’t know how “reputation” is supposed to work. A
simple model is to think of it as currency, and use Bitcoin as a proxy. Of course, a real reputation
system probably would be different from currency. There might only be a small set of authorized
reputation “sellers” (this can still be built on top of Bitcoin, or you can use a system similar to
the CA system for TLS certificates). Or there might be a system in which each person can vote for
another person at most once (though this needs to be designed in a way that is resilient to sybil
attacks).</p>

<p>Let us assume that there is a ledger out there, where each ledger entry is a certificate saying that
entity X has given one reputation point to entity Y. A public key is included, where the private key
is only known to Y. This model cleanly applies to both Bitcoin and CA systems – in Bitcoin, the
transaction is the “certificate”, and in the CA system the certificate is the certificate.</p>

<p>For additional anonymity, you can have a different private key for each certificate. I’m going to
assume this is the case, though the solutions don’t change much if it isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="solution-via-zkp">Solution via ZKP</h2>

<p>I’m very fond of the concept of a zero-knowledge proof, and when you have a hammer everything looks
like a nail.</p>

<p>So my first solution was one involving zero-knowledge proofs.</p>

<p>Construct the problem “Given the certificates in this ledger and X private keys, prove that these
private keys each have one certificate they correspond to, and that the keys are distinct”.</p>

<p>In this problem, the certificates (public keys) are hardcoded, whereas the private keys are inputs.
This sort of algorithm can be written as a sequential logic circuit, assuming that the method of
signing can be. We can then perform a zero-knowledge proof of this problem using the ZKP for general
execution <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/exploring-zero-knowledge-proofs/">outlined here</a>. The prover inserts their private keys into the algorithm,
run the algorithm, and prove that the execution was faithful and had an output of true using the ZKP.</p>

<p>Since the ZKP doesn’t leak any information about its inputs, it doesn’t leak which certificates
were the ones for which the prover had private keys, so it doesn’t leak the identities of A or B.</p>

<p>However, this is overkill. The general ZKP gets very expensive as the size of the algorithm, and
since the ledger was hardcoded in it, this ZKP will probably take a while (or a lot of computational
power) to execute. One can perform it with a subset of the ledger picked by the prover, but
repeating the process may slowly reveal the identity of the prover via the intersection of these
subsets.</p>

<h2 id="solution-via-secret-sharing">Solution via secret-sharing</h2>

<p>(This solution is technically a ZKP too, but it doesn’t use the “general” ZKP algorithm which
while expensive can be used for any combinatorical verification algorithm)</p>

<p>Once I’d gotten the “use a ZKP!” solution out of my system, I thought about it more and realized
that the problem is very close to a secret-sharing one.</p>

<p>Secret-sharing is when you want to have a cryptographic “lock” (a shared secret) which can only be
revealed/opened when the requisite quorum of (any) X keys out of N total keys is used.</p>

<p>Shamir’s secret sharing is a nice algorithm using polynomials that lets you do this.</p>

<p>In this situation, we want to prove that we have X private keys out of N total certificates in the
ledger.</p>

<p>The verifier (Victor) can construct a secret sharing problem with a single secret and N secret-
sharing-keys (in the case of Shamir, these would be N x,y-coordinate pairs). Each such key is paired
with a certificate, and is encrypted with the corresponding public key of that certificate.</p>

<p>The prover (Peggy) is given all of these encrypted secret-sharing keys, as well as the certificates
they correspond to.</p>

<p>If Peggy legitimately has X reputation, she has the X private keys necessary to obtain X of the
secret sharing keys by decrypting them. From this, she can obtain the secret. By showing the secret
to Victor, she has proven that she has at least X private keys corresponding to certificates in the
ledger, and thus has at least X reputation. In the process, <em>which</em> certificates were involved is
not revealed (so both the reputation-giver and reputation-receiver) stay anonymous.</p>

<p>Or was it?</p>

<p>Victor can construct a malicious secret sharing problem. Such a problem would basically reveal a
different secret depending on the secret-sharing-keys Peggy uses. For example, in Shamir’s secret
sharing, Victor can just give N random coordinates. X of those coordinates will always create a
degree-X curve, but the curves obtained from different sets of X coordinates will probably have a
different constant term (and thus a different secret).</p>

<p>The secret-sharing problem needs to be transmitted in a way that makes it possible for Peggy to
verify that it’s not malicious.</p>

<p>One way to do it is to make it possible to uncover <em>all</em> the secret-sharing-keys, but <em>only</em> after
the secret has been found. In Shamir’s algorithm, this can be done by pre-revealing the x
coordinates and only encrypting the y coordinates. Once Peggy has found the secret, she has the
entire polynomial curve, and can input the remaining x coordinates into the curve to find the
remaining secret sharing keys (and then verify that they have been encrypted properly).</p>

<p>This is <em>almost perfect</em>. User “otus” on Crypto Stack Exchange <a href="http://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/39274/2081">pointed out my mistake</a>.</p>

<p>The problem with this scheme (and the previous one to a lesser degree) is that Peggy could simply
brute-force the values of the y coordinates beforehand.</p>

<p>This can be solved by using nonces. Instead of encrypting each y-coordinate, Victor encrypts each
y-coordinate, <em>plus a nonce</em>. So, instead of encrypting the y-coordinate “42”, a string like
“da72ke8lv0q-42” will be encrypted.</p>

<p>On decryption, it is easy to extract the coordinate from the plaintext (presumably the scheme used
to add the nonce would be decided upon beforehand). However, we can’t brute-force for the plaintext
anymore, because the ciphertext isn’t the encryption of a low-entropy value like a regular, smallish
number, it’s the encryption of a relatively high-entropy value.</p>

<p>So far, this prevents brute forcing, but it also prevents Peggy from verifying that the secret-
sharing problem was non-malicious, since she doesn’t know the nonces. Nor can these be pre-shared
with her, since she can just use them to brute force again.</p>

<p>The solution here is for Victor to use the shared secret as a symmetric key, encrypt all of the
nonces with it, and share them with Peggy. Until Peggy knows this key, she cannot use the nonces to
brute force. Once she knows this key, she can decrypt the values for the nonces and use them to
verify that the nonces are correct.</p>

<p>This is exactly the property we need. If Peggy doesn’t have enough private keys (reputation points),
she won’t have the secret and can’t prove her reputation to Victor. Once Peggy does have the quorum
of keys, she will know the symmetric key, be able to decrypt the nonces, and use these nonces to
verify that the other N-X ciphertexts fall on the curve which she has obtained. Once she has
verified this, she can present the shared secret/symmetric key to Victor, who will know that she
had enough keys to crack the secret sharing problem and thus has at least X reputation.</p>

<hr />

<p>This was quite an entertaining problem to solve (and it got me thinking about ZKPs again, which
made me write my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/08/10/interactive-sudoku-zero-knowledge-proof/">previous post</a>). Thanks, Sarah!</p>

<p>Got an alternate solution (or other similar fun problems)? Let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in March I was particularly interested in Zero-Knowledge Proofs. At the time, I wrote
<a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/exploring-zero-knowledge-proofs/">a long blog post</a> introducing them and explaining how the ZKP for generic execution
works.</p>

<p>I was really enjoying learning about them, so I decided to do a presentation on them in my crypto
course. Sadly there wasn’t going to be time for explaining the structure of the proof for general
execution, but I could present something more fun: Sudoku.</p>

<p>Sudoku solutions can be proven via ZKP. That is to say, if Peggy has a solution to Victor’s Sudoku
problem, she can prove that she has a valid solution without ever revealing any information about
her solution to Victor (aside from the fact that it is valid).</p>

<p>To make the ZKP easier to explain, I wrote an <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/sudoku-zkp/zkp.html">interactive version of it</a>.</p>

<p>I planned to write about it then, but completely forgot till now. Oops.</p>

<p>I’m first going to explain how the ZKP is carried out before I explain how the interactive verifier
works. If you aren’t familiar with ZKPs, you might want to read
<a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/exploring-zero-knowledge-proofs/">my previous post on the subject</a> up to and including the part about proving graph colorings.</p>

<h2 id="proving-sudoku">Proving Sudoku</h2>

<p>This proof is going to be carried out very similarly to the graph coloring proof. Indeed, Sudoku can
be reduced to a graph coloring problem, though that’s not how we’re going to obtain the ZKP.</p>

<p>Victor has a Sudoku problem:</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/sudoku-problem.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Peggy has a solution:</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/sudoku-solution.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>In order to not leak information about her solution, Peggy permutes it:</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/sudoku-solution-permuted.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Basically, there is a 1-1 mapping between the old digits and the new ones. In this specific
permutation, all 3s are replaced by 4s, all 1s by 5s, etc.</p>

<p>She now commits to this permutation by committing to every individual cell. A random nonce is
obtained for each cell, and the contents of that cell are hashed along with the nonce. This
is the same commitment procedure used in the graph coloring ZKP.</p>

<p>These commitments are now sent over to Victor.</p>

<p>Victor ponders for a bit, and demands that Peggy reveal the third row of the sudoku square.</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/victor-ask.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>(Note that this is the non-permuted problem statement)</p>

<p>This row is marked in orange. There are some additional elements marked in green, which I shall
get to shortly.</p>

<p>Peggy reveals the permuted values for this row:</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/peggy-reveal-orange.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Victor can now verify that all digits 1-9 appear within this permuted row, and that they match the
commitments. This means that they appear in the original solution too (since permutation doesn’t
change this fact), and, at least for this row, the solution is correct. If Peggy didn’t have a
solution, there was a chance she’d be caught in this round if Victor had asked for the right
set of 9 squares to be revealed.</p>

<p>The procedure can be repeated (with a new permutation each time) to minimize this chance, with
Victor asking to reveal a row, column, or 3x3 subsquare each time, until he is certain that Peggy
has a solution.</p>

<p>But wait! This only works towards proving that Peggy has a valid Sudoku solution, not that this
is <em>the</em> solution to Victor’s specific problem. Victor only verified that each row/column/subsquare
had no duplicates, a property which is true for all sudoku solutions!</p>

<p>This is where the green squares come in. For any given set of “orange squares” (a row, column, or
3x3 subsquare), we take the “preset” digits appearing in the problem statement (In this case: 7, 8,
and 6) in that set of squares. All other instances of those digits preset in the problem statement
form the set of “green squares”:</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/victor-ask.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Peggy reveals the permuted values for both the green and orange squares each time:</p>

<p><img src="/images//sudoku-zkp/peggy-reveal-both.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>In addition to verifying that there are no duplicates in the orange squares, Victor additionally
verifies that the permutation is consistent. For example, the 7th element in that row is a 6, which
is already preset in the problem statement. There are two other 6s in the problem statement, one in
the 5th row 8th column, and one in the 7th row 1st column. If the permutation is consistent, their
corresponding squares in the revealed portion of the permuted solution should all have the same
digit. In this case, that number is 1. Similarly, the 5th element in that row is a preset 8, and
there’s a corresponding green square in the 5th row last column that also has an 8. In the permuted
solution, Victor verifies that they both have the same digit, in this case 7.</p>

<p>This lets Victor ensure that Peggy has a solution to his sudoku problem. The fact that two given
squares must share the same digit is invariant under permutations, so this can be safely verified.
In fact, a sudoku problem is really just a problem saying “Fill these 81 squares with 9 symbols such
that there are no duplicates in any row/column/subsquare, and these three squares have the same
symbol in them, and these five squares have the same symbol in them, and …”. So that’s all we
verify: There should be no duplicates, and the digits in certain sets of squares should be the same.</p>

<p>Note that revealing the green squares doesn’t reveal additional information about Peggy’s solution.
Assuming Peggy’s solution is correct, from comparing the problem statement with the
revealed/permuted values, Victor already <em>knows</em> that in the permutation, 7 has become 6, 8 has
become 7, and 6 has become 1. So he already knows what the other preset green squares contain, he
is just verifying them.</p>

<p>We cannot reveal anything <em>more</em> than the green squares, since that would reveal additional
information about the permutation and thus the solution.</p>

<p>Edit: This actually <em>still</em> isn’t enough, which was pointed out to me by “dooglius”
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/sudoku-zkp/issues/1">here</a>. Basically, if the sudoku problem has two digits which only appear once each,
there is nothing that can stop Peggy from coming up with a solution where these two digits have been
changed to something else (since they’ll never be in a green square). Fixing this is easy, we allow
Victor to ask Peggy to reveal just the permuted values of the presets (without simultaneously
revealing a row/column/subsquare). Victor can then verify that the preset-permutation mapping is
consistent (all presets of the same value map to the same permutation) and 1-1.</p>

<p>This check actually obviates the need of the green squares entirely. As long as there is a chance
that Victor will ask for the presets to be revealed instead of a row/column/subsquare, Peggy cannot
try to trick Victor with the solution of a different sudoku problem without the risk of getting
caught when Victor asks for the presets to be revealed. However, the green squares leak no
information, so there’s no problem in keeping them as a part of the ZKP as a way to reduce the
chances of Peggy duping Victor.</p>

<h2 id="the-interactive-verifier">The interactive verifier</h2>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/sudoku-zkp/zkp.html">interactive verifier</a>. There’s a sudoku square at the top which you can fill
with a problem, and you can fill the solution in on the first square on the Prover side – fill this
in and click Start. Since I know nobody’s going to actually do that, there’s a “Fill with known
problem/solution” that does this for you.</p>

<p>Once you’ve initiated the process, the ball is in the Prover’s court. The Prover must first permute
the solution by clicking the Permute button. You can edit the permutation if you like (to introduce
a flaw), or manually do this after clicking the button.</p>

<p>Once you’ve clicked the button, generate nonces by clicking the next one, “Populate Nonces”. These,
too can be edited. You can generate hashes (which can also be edited) by clicking the next button,
and after that send the hashes (commitments) over to the Verifier’s side.</p>

<p>The ball is now in the Verifier’s court. As you can see, there’s a set of hashes on the Verifier’s
side. The Verifier only knows the problem statement and whatever is visible on their side of the
screen, and nothing more.</p>

<p>You, acting on behalf of the Verifier, can now select a row/column/subsquare/preset using the
dropdown and text box on the Verifier. As you select, the orange/green squares that are going to be
revealed will be shown. When satisfied with your choice, click “Reveal”, and the Prover will
populate your squares with the permuted values and nonces. “Verify” will verify that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The appropriate elements and hashes are revealed</li>
  <li>The hash is equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHA256(nonce + "-" + digit)</code></li>
  <li>The orange squares contain distinct digits.</li>
  <li>The green squares contain digits that match with the orange squares they correspond to from the problem solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you click verify, it will show the probability of correctness (this isn’t an exact value, it’s
calculated using an approximate formula that doesn’t depend on the problem statement), and the ball
moves back into Peggy’s court, who can permute her solution again and continue. The probability
slowly increases each round.</p>

<p>Doing this manually till it reaches 99% is boring, so there’s a button at the top (“Run
automatically”) which can be clicked to run it for a given number of rounds, at any stage in the
process once started. If you tamper with one of the values in the permuted solution, and run it
for ~20 runs, it usually gets caught.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>I’m now working at Mozilla as a Research Engineer, on <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>.</p>

<p>I started two weeks ago, and so far I’m really enjoying it! I feel quite lucky to
get to work on an open source project; with an amazing and helpful team. Getting to do most
of my work in Rust is great, too :)</p>

<p>So far I’ve been working on the network stack (specifically, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11556">“making fetch happen”</a>),
and I’ll probably be spending time on DOM things as well.</p>

<p>So recently I read <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/">this article</a> about how the Bitcoin community had executed
what’s known as a “Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment”; a pretty neat concept.</p>

<p>What was really interesting for me was the <a href="https://people.xiph.org/~greg/simple_verifyable_execution.txt">(simplified) underlying algorithm</a> for generic
zero knowledge proofs. It took me a while (and some questions asked to helpful folks on the
Internet) to understand it fully, but the concept is quite intriguing and sounds rather magical. I
thought I’d explain it here in an accessible way, both so that others can get it and to
improve my own understanding.</p>

<p>I intend this article to be read by people with a programming or mathematical background<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>,
who have some understanding of what logic gates are. Please let me know if you feel that something
is inadequately (or wrongly) explained.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof">So what is a zero knowledge proof?</h2>

<p>Let’s say Alice has a problem she wants to solve. It could be a mathematical problem, like
factorizing a large number, or coloring a map (or graph!) with only three colors, or solving a
Sudoku puzzle. Anything where you can write a program to verify the solution.</p>

<p>She doesn’t have the resources to solve the problem herself, but wants to buy a solution from
someone else. She makes the problem public, and Bob says he has a solution.</p>

<p>However, Alice is skeptical. She’s not sure if Bob is telling the truth here, and would like some
evidence that he does indeed have a solution. At the same time, Bob is not willing to share his
solution with Alice without getting paid. They also don’t want to involve a third party; let’s say
this is a rather Important Sudoku Puzzle that affects National Security ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>What Alice and Bob need here is a way for Bob to prove to Alice that he has the solution, without
sharing the solution, and without involving a third party<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is totally possible (magical, right!). There’s a quick example
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Abstract_example">on Wikipedia</a> of a simple proof of a non-mathematical fact – whether or not someone
has a key to a particular door.</p>

<p>For proving more complicated problems, we have to digress into some basic crypto first</p>

<h2 id="interlude-hashes-and-commitments">Interlude: Hashes and commitments</h2>

<p><em>Feel free to skip this if you know what a hash function and a nonce is.</em></p>

<p>In cryptography, there’s something called a “hash function”. In essence it’s an “irreversible”
function whose output is known as a “hash”, with the following three properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s not computationally intensive to calculate the hash of an input</li>
  <li>Given a hash, it’s a computationally hard problem to calculate an input to the hash function that results in this hash, usually involving brute force</li>
  <li>It’s also a computationally hard problem, given an input and a hash, to find a different input (<em>especially</em> a different input that is similar to the first one) that produces the same hash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that multiple values <em>may</em> result in the same hash.</p>

<p>The result of this is basically that hashes are hard to forge. If Bob shares a hash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y = H(X)</code> with
Alice, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is some secret data and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code> is a hash function, if Bob reveals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> at some later
point, by checking that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y = H(X)</code>, Alice can be reasonably certain that the value shared by Bob was
indeed the original input to the hash function and not tampered with in a way that the same hash was
produced. Similarly, Bob can be certain that knowing only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, Alice cannot reverse-engineer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>
since the hash function is “irreversible”.</p>

<p>This brings us to the concept of a commitment. Hashes can be used as described above to “commit” to
a value. If Bob decides on a number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, and makes its hash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code> public, he has committed to this
value without revealing it. When he does decide to reveal it, he is forced to reveal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> and not
some modified bogus value, thus making the “commitment” binding.</p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed a flaw here: It’s hard to commit to small numbers, or things that come
from a restricted set. If Bob wishes to commit to the number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> (without revealing it), or the
color <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red</code> (out of a set of three colors), Alice can just try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H(0)</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H(9)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H(red),
H(green), H(blue)</code> and find out which one matches. After all, hashes aren’t supposed to be resilient
to brute force attacks, and brute force attacks become very easy when the set of inputs is tiny.</p>

<p>A solution to this is to use a <em>nonce</em> (also known as a “trapdoor”). Bob commits to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> by hashing
the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code> is a random value he selected, known as
a “nonce”. When Bob wishes to reveal the value, he just reveals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code> and Alice is
convinced that the original value committed to was indeed 5. Of course, this requires some agreement
on the format of the nonce; in this case the nonce is just “everything after the dash”. Note that
the nonce is private, and only revealed when Bob wishes to reveal the committed number.</p>

<p>Note that each new commitment should use a new nonce. Otherwise, information can be leaked; for
example if Bob needs to commit to three numbers (say, 2, 5, 2) in a way that they can be
individually revealed, he shouldn’t compute the hashes for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry, 5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry, 2-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code>, since the first
and last hashes will be equal and Alice will know that the committed values behind them are probably
the same too (something which you may not wish to reveal).</p>

<p>Another issue that can turn up is a “rainbow table”, where one party comes into the game with a
precomputed table of hashes of all strings up till a certain number of characters. One solution for
this is to increase the nonce size, however since Bob decides the nonces it’s possible for him to
smartly select them if he’s the one with a table. The solution here is to use a “salt”, which is a
large random string combined with the committed value and hash. Bob and Alice could, for example,
mutually decide on a salt of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asdcjyxeafxjvikfzmnyfqsehsxwxsfywbreb</code>, and when Bob wishes to
commit to the number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code>, he hashes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asdcjyxeafxjvikfzmnyfqsehsxwxsfywbreb-5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code>. Note that salts work similar
to nonces here, however the salt is known publically (you can model it as a last-minute modification
of the agreed-upon hash function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code>, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H'(X) = H(add_salt(X))</code>). In some cases, you may also
want a per-instance salt, which is mutually decided every time Bob wants to compute a hash.</p>

<p>Hashes are a useful building block for many things; they’re a key component in password security, as
well as being part of all kinds of cryptographics protocols. In this post we’ll mainly focus on
their ability to be used as a unbreakable commitment.</p>

<p>Back to your regularly scheduled blog post.</p>

<h2 id="coloring-graphs">Coloring graphs</h2>

<p>The classic example of zero knowledge proofs is graph coloring.  I’ll run through a quick
explanation, though it’s explained beautifully <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer.html">here</a> too.</p>

<p>Let’s say Alice has a graph:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/alice-graph.png" /></p>

<p>No, not that kind, Alice. The <em>other</em> graph.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-uncolored.dot.png" /></p>

<p>She wants it colored such that no two adjacent nodes share a color. This is an NP-complete problem (so
it can take up a lot of computational resources to solve). Of course, <em>this</em> graph is small and easy
to color, but that’s just for the sake of this blog post.</p>

<p>Bob, using his trusty Crayola™ 3-crayon set<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, has managed to come up with a valid coloring:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-colored.dot.png" /></p>

<p>He wishes to prove that he has this to Alice, without revealing it or involving a third party.
Probably for National Security Reasons. Something something Nicolas Cage.</p>

<p>Bob and Alice meet, and Alice gives him a large piece of paper with the (uncolored) graph drawn on
it.</p>

<p>Bob goes into a private room, and colors it. He also covers each graph node with a hat. Alice now
enters the room.</p>

<p>Alice chooses an adjacent pair of nodes. Let’s say she chooses 1 and 2. Bob removes those two hats
(since Alice is watching him, he has no chance to tamper with the colorings underneath the hats
before revealing them). Now, Alice knows the colors of nodes 1 and 2:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-12.dot.png" /></p>

<p>This lets her verify that nodes 1 and 2 had different colorings in the graph Bob drew.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t actually <em>tell</em> her anything about Bob’s coloring aside from the increased
probability of correctness. The colors can always be permuted, so <em>any</em> valid coloring would give
the same answer here if the colors were permuted so that 1 is red and 2 is blue. This is important;
we don’t want to leak information about Bob’s solution aside from the fact that it is correct.</p>

<p>Nor is this information enough to verify correctness. Bob could have equally drawn a wrong
coloring.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-wrong.dot.png" /></p>

<p>(clearly someone wasn’t paying attention in kindergarten)</p>

<p>Since Alice only looked at nodes 1 and 2, she didn’t see anything wrong with the graph. But if she
had by chance picked nodes 3 and 4, Bob’s deception would have been revealed.</p>

<p>So she only has 14% (1/7) certainity<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that Bob’s graph is correct.</p>

<p>However, we can run this experiment again. Bob can permute the colors, draw on a fresh copy of the
graph, and ask Alice to choose another pair of adjacent nodes. She can check this, and the
probability of correctness will increase to around 27% (1 - (6/7)*(6/7)).</p>

<p>Since Bob has permuted the colors, Alice cannot use the information from the previous round to glean
any information about Bob’s solution in this round. Of course, Bob is free to produce a completely
different coloring (one that is not a permutation), with a different flaw this time. Regardless of
where the flaw is, Alice still has a chance of uncovering it each time.</p>

<p>This can continue until Alice is satisfied that there is a very little chance that Bob has cheated.
For example, after 60 rounds, Alice would be 99.99% certain.</p>

<p>Note that this didn’t actually involve any cryptography; it was an algorithm based on <em>information
flow</em>. However, if you want this to work securely (in the current solution Alice could push Bob away
and reveal all the nodes herself) and make it work without requiring Alice and Bob to be in the same
location, you need to use hashes.</p>

<p>Remember when Bob colored the graph whilst alone in the secret room? Once Alice had entered the
room, this coloring was <em>committed</em>. There was no way for Bob to tamper with this coloring.</p>

<p>We do the same thing here. After obtaining a valid coloring, Bob <em>commits</em> to this coloring by
calculating some hashes.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Node</th><th>Color(private)</th><th>Nonce(private)</th><th>Hash</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr><td>1</td><td>red</td><td>wmdqatobck</td><td>e1f957bedcceeb217305bfa12cbee4abac36eff1</td></tr>

</table>
<p><br /></p>

<p>(The hashes here are calculated using SHA-1 for the hashing algorithm. It’s not considered very
secure anymore, but the secure ones all output huge hashes which spill over the page)</p>

<p>Bob sends the public part of the table (the node-hash mapping) to Alice. Alice asks for nodes 1 and
2, and Bob reveals the entire table entry for those two nodes (including the nonce).</p>

<p>Note that since Alice now knows the color and nonce for nodes 1 and 2, she can verify that the
colors shown are indeed the ones Bob committed to. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo red-wmdqatobck | sha1sum</code> if you want to
check on a local Unixy shell.</p>

<p>As in the previous case, Alice can repeat this algorithm until she reaches an acceptable level of
certainty (each time with a permutation of colors and a new set of nonces).</p>

<p>A lot of zero knowledge proofs (but not all!) are inherently probabalistic and interactive. They
involve multiple rounds where in each round the prover (Bob) commits to something, the verifier
(Alice) challenges the prover to reveal some information. The process repeats, with the certainity
on the verifier’s side approaching 100% as more and more rounds happen.</p>

<h2 id="zero-knowledge-proof-for-general-execution">Zero Knowledge Proof for General Execution</h2>

<p>It turns out that you can have a ZKP exchange for the execution of any algorithm that can be
transcribed into combinatorical logic. In other words, you should be able to write the program
without loops and recursion, though loops bounded by a constant are allowed<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This isn’t as
restrictive as it seems, usually <em>verification</em> is a straightforward task not involving convoluted
loops. The examples above (graph coloring<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, sudoku, prime factorization<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>) can all be verified
without loops.</p>

<p>The algorithm shown here is by Gregory Maxwell, originally published <a href="https://people.xiph.org/~greg/simple_verifyable_execution.txt">here</a>. It’s somewhat
inefficient, but it demonstrates the idea behind ZKP for general execution. As mentioned there, it
can be optimized using techniques described in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/155.pdf">this paper</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s get started. Any combinatorical program can be decomposed into a bunch of AND and NOT
gates, taking in a bunch of input values and giving out one or more output values. For simplicity
let’s assume that the problem statement (i.e. the specific sudoku puzzle, etc) that needs verifying
is embedded inside the program, and the final output of the program is just a single boolean
indicating whether or not the input is a solution. This algorithm, however, can work for programs
with arbitrarily large outputs.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob do this decomposition. The also agree on a numbering of the AND gates. Let’s say
that there are N AND gates. We’re mostly going to ignore the NOT gates for the purpose of this
article – they’re there, but they aren’t modified or anything.</p>

<h3 id="creating-encrypted-and-gates">Creating encrypted AND gates</h3>

<p>Now, Bob creates 4*N <em>encrypted AND gates</em>. This is an AND gate, but with the
inputs and outputs all muddled up.</p>

<p>This is a regular AND gate:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-and.png" width="200" /></p>

<p>This is an encrypted AND gate:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-and.png" width="200" /></p>

<p>(yes, it can be identical to an AND gate)</p>

<p>So is this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr1.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>and this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr2.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Basically, each input and the output may or may not be inverted. We can model this in a different
way, there is an <em>encryption key</em> corresponding to each input and output. This key is XORd with the
input/output (so if the key is 1, the wire is inverted, and if the key is 0, the wire is not
inverted).</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr-xor.png" width="500" /></p>

<p>A regular AND gate has a truth table as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Input 1</th>
      <th>Input 2</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This truth table, encrypted (with the input keys \(e_1 = 1, e_2 = 0\) and output key \(e_o = 1\))
is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Encrypted Input 1</th>
      <th>Encrypted Input 2</th>
      <th>Encrypted Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
So, if the encrypted gate gets the (encrypted) inputs 1 and 0, its (encrypted) output will be 1.</p>

<p>Since XOR is its own inverse (\(x \oplus y \oplus y\) is just \(x\)), if we wish to encrypt
an input before piping it through this gate, we just XOR it with the relevant input key. If we wish
to decrypt the output, we again XOR it with the output key. The XOR gates being applied will just
cancel out with the internal encryption gates. In other words, encryption and decryption are done
with the same operation!</p>

<p>To recap, the dotted box below is an encrypted AND gate. An encrypted input enters from the left,
and is decrypted by the internal XOR gate to obtain the actual input, which is piped through the AND
gate. To encrypt an input so that it can be passed into this gate, one uses the same key with an XOR
(not shown in the diagram). Similarly, the actual output of the AND gate exits on the right, and is
encrypted by the XOR gate at the output to get the “encrypted output” (the wire that extends out of
the box). To decrypt this, one must apply the same XOR operation to the encrypted output to recover
the actual output of the gate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr-xor.png" width="500" /></p>

<h3 id="creating-adaptation-keys-and-commitments">Creating adaptation keys and commitments</h3>

<p>Now, unlike regular AND gates, these encrypted AND gates cannot be composed. The output of an
encrypted AND gate is encrypted, with a potentially different encryption key as to that of the next
gate’s input. So, we insert an “adaptation key” between the two. For example, if the output of the
first gate is connected to the first input of the second gate, we need to insert this operation
between the two gates:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr-adapt.png" width="500" /></p>

<p>We XOR by \(e_o\) of the first gate (to decrypt), and then again XOR by \(e_1\) of the second gate (to
reencrypt). This operation is the same as XORing by \(e_o \oplus e_1\), which is the
“adaptation key”. Every pair of encrypted gates will have an adaptation key for every configuration
they can be placed in.</p>

<p>Alright. Bob creates a ton of these “encrypted gates”, and calculates all the adaptation keys for every possible pair of gates. He also mixes up the truth tables of each encrypted gate<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Now, he commits to these truth tables. A commitment for each entry in each truth table is made, so
he’ll end up with something like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Encrypted Input 1</th>
      <th>Encrypted Input 2</th>

He also commits to each of the adaptation keys and each of the encryption keys.</p>

<p>As usual, all the commitments will be sent to Alice. Alice will then have data like: “Commitment for
Gate 1 entry 1: .., Commitment for Gate 2 entry 2:.., … Commitment for Gate 2 entry 1: .., ….
Commitment for adaptation key between Gate 1’s output and Gate 2’s first input: .., Commitment for
adaptation key between Gate 1’s output and Gate 2’s second input: .., Commitment for encryption key
for Gate 1’s first input, …”.</p>

<h3 id="shuffling-and-revealing">Shuffling and revealing</h3>

<p>These commitments are taken in some predefined order, and the resultant monster string is hashed
(without a nonce). This “superhash” is used as the seed to a pseudorandom number generator which is
used to shuffle the gates. Both Alice and Bob can calculate this shuffling.</p>

<p>This post-shuffle ordering is used after this point. The hash-shuffle is important here because it
adds a layer of tamper protection. If Bob wishes to tamper with the, say 4th gate post-shuffle, Bob
would have to create a bad gate before making the commitments; this changes the commitments, and
thus the shuffle order, and so the tampered gate will not end up being the 4th gate. Basically, it’s
hard to control where the tampered gate will end up.</p>

<p>Now, out of the 4N  gates, Bob takes the last 2N, and reveals everything about them: Their
encryption keys, the nonces for their truth table commitments, and all adaptation keys between
these gates (along with the nonces for the adaptation key commitments).</p>

<p>Alice ensures that everything in this revealed data adds up. All the truth tables, after decryption,
should actually be AND gate truth tables. All adaptation keys must match up with their relevant
encryption keys. All commitments must match up.</p>

<h3 id="double-trouble">Double trouble!</h3>

<p>Bob duplicates the AND-and-NOT-gate based circuit. He now has two identical circuits which take
the same inputs, and have one output each. In itself this is pretty useless; this circuit is
obviously redundant. However, in the context of encrypted gates, this redundancy becomes useful.</p>

<p>Bob drops in the 2*N encrypted gates into this double-circuit, using the post-shuffle ordering of
encrypted gates and the predecided numbering<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> of the AND gates in the circuit. He puts the
necessary adaptation gates (i.e. an XOR operation with the relevant adaptation key) between
encrypted AND gates to make the circuit work. Note that each “half” of the circuit has a different
set of encrypted gates, and thus a different encryption key for each input. There are NOT gates here
too (from the original circuit, which was made of ANDs and NOTs); they stay in place (the adaptation
gate can go on either side of them) with no modifications or encryption.</p>

<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>

<p>Let’s recall that Bob is claiming to have the correct input for the original circuit – the input
that makes that circuit output true.</p>

<p>Since Bob has all the encryption keys, he can encrypt this correct input to get the correct
encrypted input, which should make the new circuit output true (well, encrypted true) as well.</p>

<p>Bob goes ahead and does this. He encrypts the input (since there are different encryption keys for
either side of the circuit, he does this twice), and runs it through the circuit. He notes down the
truth table entry utilized for each gate. He ensures that the output, once decrypted, is true (it
should be, if everything has been done correctly till now).</p>

<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>

<p>He now reveals the details of the program execution to Alice. He reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All adaptation gates involved (and their nonces, to verify the commitments)</li>
  <li>All truth table <em>entries</em> involved in the execution (and their nonces …).</li>
  <li>The output encryption key (and its nonce)</li>
  <li>The encrypted inputs</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice goes ahead and verifies that the commitments have not been reneged upon. Note that she also
now has a full execution history. It’s an <em>encrypted</em> history – she can’t calculate the original
input from it – but she can verify that the execution was faithfully carried out. While she doesn’t
have the entire truth table for any encrypted gate, she has the entry that was used in the
execution, which is enough. She just has to ensure that the inputs to a gate match the truth table
entry, use the entry to see what the output is, apply the relevant adaptation key to get the input
for the next gate, and repeat.</p>

<p>And there you have it. Alice has verified that Bob faithfully executed her verification circuit, and
thus he must have the correct answer to her problem.</p>

<h3 id="tampering">Tampering?</h3>

<p>Let’s see if it’s possible for Bob to tamper with any of this. If Bob wishes to tamper with one of
the gates, he has to tamper with the gates before calculating commitments, which means that the
shuffling will get mixed up, which will mean that he can’t control where the tampered gate will end
up in the final circuit. This is compounded by the fact that half the gates are revealed (so the
tampered gate may end up in the wrong set), and that there are <em>two</em> copies of the circuit (so you
need to tamper with both sides simultaneously, requiring even more luck on getting the shuffle where
you want it).</p>

<p>The probability of Bob being able to execute a succesful tamper can be adjusted by increasing the
number of revealed gates, and increasing the duplication of the circuit. There is also the
aforementioned fudge factor that can be introduced by having Alice choose where each encrypted gate
should go after Bob has already provided commitments, and finally the procedure can be repeated as
many times as necessary with a fresh set of encrypted gates to increase certainty. Unlike the graph
coloring algorithm (where the uncertainty in a single run was large – if Bob has a couple of wrong
edges there’s relatively small chance he’ll get caught); here in a single run it is Bob who has a
massive disadvantage, since he must tamper with <em>exactly</em> the right gates, and there’s very little
chance that his tampered gates will fall in the right place based on Alice’s chosen ordering.
Additionally, tampering with the gates in the first place is hard, since you need to avoid having
them get revealed. I think that with reasonable (e.g., not asking for something like 1000 duplicated
circuits) choices on the level of duplication and number of revealed gates, it’s possible for Alice
to get a very high level of certainty without needing to conduct multiple rounds.</p>

<p>How about the opposite question: Can Alice find out anything about the input, aside from the fact
that it is correct, from the information she has? At first glance it seems like she can, because she
can see the whole path of execution. In case of a program with non-constant loops, this would be
damning, since she can figure out how many executions happened (and thus know the decrypted value
for the number of loop iterations) and backtrack using that in a cleverly-written program. However,
this program has no loops.</p>

<p>Looking at it closely, any encrypted history of execution can be changed to a different encrypted
history of execution for the same nonencrypted execution by adding NOT gates wherever they don’t
match, and then absorbing these NOT gates into the input or output keys (by NOTing them) of the
adjacent encrypted AND gates. This means that without knowing the details of the encrypted gates,
all histories of execution are equally possible for a given actual execution<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>. Therefore,
knowing only a history of execution does not provide you further information about the actual
execution, since it could equally have been for some other history of execution.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-fixing-the-escrow-and-bitcoin">Bonus: Fixing the escrow and Bitcoin</h2>

<p>(I’m going to assume basic knowledge of Bitcoin later on in this section)</p>

<p>After all this, we still only have a way of Bob <em>proving</em> he has a solution. There’s no way of
securely exchanging the solution for money (or whatever) without involving a trusted third party to
handle the swap. This is known as <em>escrow</em>, where a third party is given both items for swapping;
and after checking that everything is in order the third party completes the swap.</p>

<p>We can build on this so that the third party is only trusted with the money, and cannot actually
peek at the answer.</p>

<p>It’s pretty straightforward: Bob and Alice mutually agree on a shared secret “pad” P. Bob takes his
answer, bitwise-XORs it with the pad (which is of the same length as the answer) to get padded input
X, and then hashes it to get hash Y.</p>

<p>Now, initially we had a verification program which proves the statement “This input is a solution to
Alice’s problem”. We modify this program so that it proves the following two statements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This input is a solution to Alice’s problem</li>
  <li>When the input is XORd with P, and subsequently hashed, the hash that comes out is Y</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice and Bob now go through the ZKP algorithm and the above is proven. Of course, they must keep
the exchange between themselves, since the value of the pad (which can be extracted from the
circuit) must remain secret.</p>

<p>Assuming that Bob isn’t able to cause any hash collisions, Alice at this point would be happy with a
number that, when hashed, gives Y. This is something that escrow can verify, since neither Y nor X
can be reverse-engineered to get the original answer unless you have P.</p>

<p>Now, Alice puts the money in escrow, and notifies the third party handing escrow of the value of Y
(the hash). Bob puts the padded input X in escrow as well. The third party verifies that Y is the
hash of X, and releases the money to Bob and the padded input to Alice. Since Alice knows pad P, she
can XOR it with X to recover the original real input. Everyone walks away happy!</p>

<p>Well, maybe not. There still is the danger of the third party handling escrow to walk away with the
money. Why trust any one party?</p>

<p>Turns out that Bitcoin proves to be an alternative to this situation. The technique described in
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/">Greg Maxwell’s article</a> (called Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment), builds upon
the above protocol using “scripts” in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The way a Bitcoin transaction works is that anyone (well, the first person) who can solve the
embedded challenge is allowed to use the money contained in it. Like a piñata. Except with money
instead of candy and public-key cryptography instead of a stick.</p>

<p><em>Most</em> Bitcoin transactions pay directly to a person, and they use a standard kind of challenge (the
actual script is <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Standard_Transaction_to_Bitcoin_address_.28pay-to-pubkey-hash.29">here</a>). If Alice wishes to pay Bob 5 BTC, Alice crafts a
transaction which says “anyone with the private key behind Bob’s public key (his address) may spend
this money”. Of course, in practice this means that only Bob can spend the money. Alice created a
piñata which only Bob can break.</p>

<p>We can build on this to make the Bitcoin network behave as a trustworthy escrow. After having
stepped through the zero-knowledge protocol and being confident that Y is the hash of the padded
input, Alice crafts a transaction which says “anyone with a string that results in this hash may
spend this money”<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>. Bob has this string; it is the padded answer X. He makes a transaction with
X as part of the input script (so that he can claim the money); and the Bitcoin network accepts it.
Assuming Alice and Bob are not able to tamper with each others’ local networks, by the time Alice
sees the transaction containing X, the network should have accepted this transaction already (though
it may not yet be part of the blockchain), and Bob should be getting his money.</p>

<p>(In case the crucial part is trusting that the escrow doesn’t run off with the money, and you don’t
care if other people can see the answer, you can skip the padding step and directly hash the input.
I believe the proof of concept executed in Greg’s post did this, but I’m not sure)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One reason I really like open source is that it offers a lot of great opportunities for newish programmers to get some hands-on experience with real world problems. There’s only so much one can learn from small personal projects; but in open source one often gets to tackle interesting problems on large codebases — problems which wouldn’t occur in small/personal ones. There are also valuable skills related to collaboration to be learnt.</p>

<p>Because of this, I care quite a bit about making projects welcoming to new contributions, and try to improve this experience on projects I’m involved in. I’ve picked up a few tricks along the way. Most of these aren’t my ideas, I’ve gleaned them from watching people like <a href="https://twitter.com/lastontheboat">Josh Matthews</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mleibovic">Margaret Leibovic</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_conley">Mike Conley</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/redheadedcuban">Joel Maher</a> do their thing. If you’re interested, <a href="http://blog.margaretleibovic.com/2013/08/06/increasing-volunteer-participation-on-the-firefox.html">here</a> is a post by Margaret, and <a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/fsoss15/contribution.html">here</a> are some of Josh’s slides from a presentation, both on the same subject.</p>

<p>Before I get started, bear in mind that making a project “newbie-friendly” isn’t something that magically happens. Like most things, it takes effort, but often this effort can come to fruition in the form of motivated contributors helping out on your project and eventually even becoming co-maintainers. It’s really worth it!</p>

<h2 id="the-simple-stuff">The simple stuff</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of really easy stuff you can do to kickstart contributions to your own project. Most of this is obvious:</p>

<h3 id="contributingmd">CONTRIBUTING.md</h3>

<p><strong>Add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTING.md</code></strong> file. Keep it up to date. Link to it prominently from the README. The README should also have clear and detailed instructions for building the project. These two files are different – README is for those who want to use your project (perhaps by building from sources), CONTRIBUTING is for people who want to contribute.</p>

<p><strong>Mention steps for getting involved</strong>: how to find something to work on, how to send a patch/make a pull request, a checklist of things to ensure your patch/PR satisfies before submission (e.g. passing tests, commit message guidelines, etc).
Additionally, include some tips and tricks (like a link to the internal documentation) that can help new contributors, links to communication channels (IRC, Slack, Gitter, whatever) and anything else you may find helpful for someone considering contributing to your project. If you use some form of issue labeling, explanations of the labeling scheme can help folks find stuff they want to work on. An overview of the directory structure can be similarly helpful.</p>

<p>For some examples, check out the CONTRIBUTING.md files for <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">rust-clippy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="maintain-a-list-of-easy-bugs">Maintain a list of easy bugs</h3>

<p>More on this later, but try to <strong>use some form of tagging to mark easy bugs</strong>. I love <a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/fsoss15/contribution.html?full#issuetracker">this slide</a> from Josh’s talk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to politely say f*** off</p>

  <p>“Choose something to work on from our issue tracker.” <br />
                                           - every project maintainer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most bugs on issue trackers are nontrivial, steeped with jargon, devoid of actionable information, or otherwise inaccessible to the average new contributor. It’s relatively low effort to recognize bugs which are “easy” for maintainers, but it’s a lot of work for people unfamiliar to this project to figure this out.</p>

<p>A simple label on GitHub is all you need in most cases. Be sure to link to it from your contributing file!</p>

<h3 id="communicate">Communicate!</h3>

<p><strong>Have open channels</strong> for communication. IRC is often the favorite here, though IRC is pretty alien for people getting involved in open source for the first time. If you’re using IRC, see if you can link to a web client (like <a href="https://wiki.mibbit.com/index.php/Widget">Mibbit</a>) with short instructions on how to join. Stuff like Gitter works too.</p>

<p>Mailing lists also work — everyone knows how to email! However, email can be intimidating to newcomers; many have a “omg I can’t ask my silly questions here!” attitude which stops them from progressing.</p>

<p>Explicitly inviting questions in each issue helps here. Clippy doesn’t have a mailing list or IRC channel (too small a project), but I encourage people working on new bugs to ping me on any communication channel they’d like. I’ve mentored people over email, GH issue threads, IRC, even reddit PMs, and it’s worked out fine in each case.</p>

<p>Often folks will PM you for help. Provide help, but <strong>encourage them to ask questions</strong> in the main venue. This has the twofold benefit of showing everyone that the main channel is open to questions, and it also helps people get quicker answers since someone else can answer if you’re not around.</p>

<h3 id="recognition">Recognition</h3>

<p><strong>Celebrate new contributors</strong>. Tweet about them. Mention them in blog posts. Getting a two-line patch accepted in an open source project doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re just getting started, it’s a very awesome feeling. Make it more awesome! Both <a href="http://this-week-in-rust.org/">This Week In Rust</a> and <a href="https://blog.servo.org/">This Week In Servo</a> mention new contributors (sometimes we tweet about it too), and I’ve often got very happy messages from these contributors about the mentions.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-code-of-conduct">Add a code of conduct</h3>

<p>A lot of folks have had bad experiences with people online, often in other open source communities and may be wary about joining others. <strong>A code of conduct</strong> is a statement that unsavory behavior won’t be tolerated, which helps make the project more welcoming and appealing to these people, simultaneously making it a nicer place which is helpful for everyone. Of course, you should be prepared to enforce the code of conduct if the situation requires it.</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html">Rust code of conduct</a> but the <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> is good, too. Various language/framework communities often have their own favorite code of conduct. Pick one.</p>

<h3 id="empathize">Empathize!</h3>

<p>We often forget how hard it is to jumpstart in something we’re an active part of. For example, for many of us the process of making a pull request is almost second nature.</p>

<p>However, not everyone is used to these things. I’ve seen contributors who can code well but haven’t used Github in the past having lots of trouble making and updating a pull request. The same applies to other workflow things; like code review, version control<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, or build system peculiarities.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind when dealing with new contributors. These are skills which can be picked up relatively quickly, but those without them will have a frustrating experience and end up asking you a lot of questions.</p>

<h2 id="improving-the-newcomer-experience">Improving the newcomer experience</h2>

<p>Alright, now you’ve gotten all the basics done. People now have a vague idea of how to contribute to your project. Let’s make it more concrete.</p>

<h3 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h3>

<p>Don’t just leave an easy bug open. <strong>Offer to mentor it!</strong> This is a very fun and rewarding experience, and of course contributors are more likely to stick around in a project they percieve to be helpful and welcoming.</p>

<p>It’s often better to go one step further and <strong>give tips for fixing the issue before anyone even picks it up</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10969#issuecomment-158282317">example</a>). Communication in open source has latency — the contributor might be on the other side of the planet, or might otherwise be contributing at a different time of the day than you<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Reducing the number of back-and-forth cycles is really helpful here, and giving some info so that a contributor can get started immediately without needing to wait for a response goes a long way in improving the newcomer experience.</p>

<p>Avoid creating a mentored bug where you yourself aren’t certain on how to fix it. Ideally, <strong>you should know the exact steps to take to fix a bug</strong> before marking it as mentored. Don’t divulge all the steps to the mentee, but the exercise of solving the bug yourself (without writing the code) ensures that there aren’t any hidden traps.</p>

<p>Mostly mentorship just involves <strong>answering questions and laying out a path</strong> for the mentee. Be sure to encourage questions in the first place! A lot of people, especially students, are intimidated when joining open source and try to stay as quiet as possible. For a healthy mentorship, you want them to ask questions. A lot. Encourage this.</p>

<p>Remember that in many cases the new contributor may be intimidated by <em>you</em>. For example, I’ve often come across new Firefox contributors (who I introduced to the project) asking me questions instead of their assigned mentor because “the mentor works for Mozilla and is way too awesome for me to bug with questions”. This wasn’t something the mentor told them (Firefox mentors are all very nice and helpful people), it was a conclusion they came to on their own — one which would impede their progress on the bug.</p>

<p>One trick that helps mitigate this is encouraging questions in your main channel. When people PM me with questions on IRC, I answer their questions, but also encourage them to ask in the main IRC channel next time. This is good for everyone — It gives the channel an aura of being “okay to ask questions in” (if other people see that questions are being asked and answered in the channel), and it also lets other maintainers jump in to help the new contributor in case I’m not around.</p>

<p>Once a new contributor has fixed a bug, mentorship isn’t over – it’s just started! See if you can find something more involved for them to work in a related area of the codebase. Get to know the contributor too, a sense of familiarity goes a long way in reducing intimidation and other friction.</p>

<h3 id="tailoring-process-for-newcomers">Tailoring process for newcomers</h3>

<p>Most open source projects have a set of hoops you have to jump through for a pull request to be accepted. These are necessary for the health of the project and pretty straightforward for existing contributors, but can be intimidating for new ones. They also add extra cycles of communication. I’ve often seen people put up almost-working patches, and disappear after a few cycles — even though the bulk of the work was done and there were just process issues (or code nits) left over for merging; which can be quite disheartening. Reducing extra process helps mitigate this.</p>

<p>For example, Servo uses this great tool called <a href="http://reviewable.io/">Reviewable</a> for code review. Regular contributors don’t have much friction whilst using this, so we use it wherever possible. However, for small pull requests from new contributors I avoid using Reviewable and instead opt to review directly from the GitHub interface. For these pull requests I don’t need Reviewable’s features, so I don’t lose much, but now the contributor has to go through one less hoop.</p>

<p>Similarly, for rust-clippy, I often make minor fixes and run <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/blob/master/util/update_lints.py">the readme update script</a> on behalf of the contributor instead of asking them to do it themselves. I usually check out the PR locally, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git merge pr-branch --no-commit --no-ff</code><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, make edits, commit and push. This way the PR still gets marked as merged (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit --amend</code> doesn’t do that), and the history stays bisectable.</p>

<p>OpenSSL uses a mailing list for patches, however they allow contributions via GitHub too. Most seasoned contributors probably stick to the mailing list, but new contributors can use the familiar GitHub interface if they want, reducing friction.</p>

<p>Of course, cutting down on (necessary) process should only be done for the first one or two contributions; try to educate the newcomer about your processes as time passes.</p>

<p>An alternate way to tackle this issue is to go the other way around and teach process first. Give newcomers an extremely easy bug that just involves replacing a string or some other simple one-line fix, and help them push it through the process. This way, the next time they work on something, they’ll be familiar with the process and be able to devote more time to the actual code.</p>

<h3 id="creating-easy-bugs">Creating easy bugs</h3>

<p>At some point down this road many projects have a problem where there are people who want to contribute, but not enough suitable easy bugs.</p>

<p>One technique that has helped me create a lot of easy bugs is to just <strong>look out for separable and non-critical subfeatures when working on something</strong>. There often are things like polish or other small features which you don’t need to include in the main pull request, but you do anyway because it’s a few extra seconds of work. If you think it can be split out as an easy bug, go ahead and file it!</p>

<p>For example, whilst working on some <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/b677f0f4ae718c9c6953134bbed27656a6aeb48d">form issues</a>, instead of completely implementing something, I implemented just what I needed, and <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/7726">filed an easy bug</a>. <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/4534">This</a> is another bug with a very similar situation; I’d implemented the framework for form submission, made it work with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code>, and filed an easy bug for wiring it up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may not find a subfeature that can be split out, but you may notice something else which could be improved. <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/7517">This</a> is an example of such an issue. I was working on something else, and noticed that this area of the code could be designed better. Whilst I could have fixed it myself with very little effort as part of my other changes, I made it into an easy bug instead.</p>

<p><strong>Simple refactorings</strong> can be a source of easy bugs too. These require familiarity with the language, but not much more, so they’re ideal for people new to the project.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to take a hard bug and make it easier, either by partially implementing it, or giving enough hints (code links, explanations, etc) that the hard part is already taken care of.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid making “critical” (i.e, needs to land in a week or two) features into easy bugs</strong>. Even simple changes can take a while for new contributors (especially due to the nature of asynchronous communication, lack of time, and/or getting bogged down in the process). Easy bugs should be something which you <em>eventually</em> want, but are okay with it taking longer to solve. It’s very disheartening for a new contributor if they are working on something and a maintainer solves it for them because it was needed to land quickly. (Given enough time this will eventually happen for some bug, in such a case see if you can provide a different bug for them to work on and apologize)</p>

<h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3>

<p>Make it super easy for newcomers to <strong>find a bug they <em>want</em> to work on</strong>; not just any easy bug!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/">Bugs Ahoy</a> and <a href="http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/">What Can I do for Mozilla</a> are both great examples of this. Servo has <a href="http://servo.github.io/servo-starters/">servo-starters</a>.</p>

<p>There are also various sites where you can list your easy bugs, some of which are listed in <a href="http://edunham.net/2015/11/04/beyond_openhatch.html">Emily’s post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="projects-and-more-involved-participation">Projects and more involved participation</h3>

<p>Having easy bugs and mentoring newcomers is just one step. You probably want to have these newcomers working on harder stuff, projects, and perhaps eventually maintianing/reviewing!</p>

<p>For many people these steps may not necessarily require involvement from you; I’ve seen professional software developers move their way to being a maintainer with very little mentorship just because they’re experienced enough to figure out how the project works on their own.</p>

<p>However, many of your contributors may be students or otherwise inexperienced; indeed they may be contributing to your project to <em>gain</em> this experience and become better developers. Such people can become valuable members of the team with some effort.</p>

<p>This mostly involves <strong>nudging people towards harder bugs and/or projects</strong>. It’s also very valuable to maintain a list of “student projects” (noncritical but large bodies of work). These can be picked up by contributors or sometimes students wishing to do a project for course credit.</p>

<p>It’s important to <strong>try and provide a logical series of issues</strong> instead of picking things randomly around the project so that the contributor can focus on one part of the codebase while starting out. If the issues all culminate in a large feature, even better.</p>

<p>Joel Maher and the Mozilla Tools team <a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/hacking-on-a-defined-length-contribution-program/">have started a pretty great program called “Quarter of Contribution”</a> which provides focused mentorship for a particular project. It seems to work out well. Programs like Google Summer of Code and Outreachy also provide ways for new contributors to try out your project at a significant level of involvement.</p>

<p><em>Creating</em> such projects or harder bugs is a nontrivial problem, and I don’t have a clear idea on how this can be done (aside from using similar techniques as listed in the “creating easy bugs” section above). Ideas welcome!</p>

<p>Projects aren’t always necessary here either. Depending on the contributor, sometimes you can present them with a regular (i.e., not “easy” or otherwise earmarked) issue to work on, provide some hints, and tell them to try and figure stuff out without your help (or with less help). Stay involved, and encourage them to ask questions of others or initiate discussions, but try to stick to observing. It’s really fun to watch someone figure stuff out on their own. I did this with a contributor <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30377">here</a>, where I only provided the initial hint and the code review; as well as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/29989">here</a>, where I encouraged the contributor to initiate and direct the relevant bikeshedding on various channels without my involvement. The contributor is now more in touch with the Rust community and codebase as a result; and for me I enjoyed watching him figure stuff out and direct discussions on his own.</p>

<h2 id="mentor-share">Mentor! Share!</h2>

<p>I’m still exploring these techniques myself. I’ve had great results applying some of these to <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/">clippy</a>, and we already apply many of them to Servo. I’m <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/mentoring-newcomers-to-the-rust-ecosystem/3088">slowly working on applying these techniques to Rust</a>.</p>

<p>While some of these projects I’m always open to hearing about more ideas for making it easier for newcomers to contribute, so please let me know if you have any ideas or experiences to share!</p>

<p>Mentoring, while a lot of work, is an insanely rewarding experience, and I hope you try to incorporate it into your open source projects!</p>
