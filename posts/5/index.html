  <div class="entry-content"><p>More than a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">year ago</a> I blogged (and <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/04/50-more-shades-of-green.html">blogged again</a> later) about my
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth">ongoing github streak</a>.</p>

<p>The GitHub streak has since gone on for more than 500 days<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and has been a really enriching experience.</p>

<p>Yesterday; I noticed something. I had reached end-game with this exercise. The streak is something I don&rsquo;t think about anymore,
and I don&rsquo;t make any efforts to keep it going. It just &hellip; happens. My involvement in open source has reached a level where
I don&rsquo;t need to consciously try contributing daily; I have enough interests/responsibilities that the streak is a side effect. This is despite
my current internship being at a place where the code I&rsquo;m working on is not hosted on GitHub (unlike last year). If the streak breaks, I won&rsquo;t
particularly care; and I <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> been caring for a while now.</p>

<p>&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s amazing. Despite me not realizing it at the time, this is the state of affairs that such an exercise would ideally
lead to &mdash; the initial motivation for the exercise replaced with something more substantial, until the excercise is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>I initially started this off after realizing that I had inadvertantly been contributing daily to open source for a week or so. In the past, my
contributions to open source used to be in bursts, which meant that I would be out of touch at times. I decided to try and work on extending this.
After around 30 days, I had a concrete habit. After around 40, I realized that I&rsquo;d become much more efficient at working on random bugs (even in unfamiliar codebases),
thus being able to spend more time writing real code.</p>

<p>Initially I had set a bunch of rules (listed in my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">original post</a>), which had stuff like issues/readme edits not counting (and no date manipulation!). I tweaked the rules around the 80-mark
to include issues/readmes when I had written code that day but it was lost in a commit squash or rebase. I think much later I dropped the rules about issues and readme edits entirely;
just considering &ldquo;anything that shows up on the punchcard which is not a result of date manipulation&rdquo; to be valid. At that point I was already quite involved in multiple projects
and didn&rsquo;t care so much about the streak or the original rules &mdash; it was just a habit at that point.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a regular contributor to both the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> projects. I also have a bunch of personal projects (<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-tenacious">lints</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-extensible">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-adorn">syntax extensions</a> for Rust, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">gc</a>, along with a lot of older projects that I don&rsquo;t actively work on but maintain) and am trying to regularly blog. I&rsquo;ve
also gotten well into the habit of sending pull requests for fixing mistakes or annoyances. When all this comes together, I end up with at least one contribution a day. Sometimes more.
I have tons of things queued that I want to work on (both personal and as a part of Servo/Rust/elsewhere), if only I had the time.</p>

<p>If you do have enough spare time, I do recommend trying this. Once you get enough momentum the power of habit will keep it going, and if
my case is anything of an indicator<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> you&rsquo;ll eventually have a good chunk of contributions and some concrete open source involvement.</p>

<p>Please note that GitHub streaks shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a metric, <em>ever</em>. They&rsquo;re great for self motivation. As a metric for tracking employee performance,
or for filtering interview candidates; not so much. It&rsquo;s way too rough a metric (like LoC written), and oversimplifies the work that goes into code.
As far as using it to boost interview candidates; not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source after a day job in programming,
and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>. I&rsquo;m a physics student &mdash; programming is like a hobby for me<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> which I&rsquo;ll gladly do daily. Now that I have a programming intern,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will be days where I don&rsquo;t want to program further after leaving the office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This post is now <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/choosing-your-guarantees.html">a part of the official rust book</a></em></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a> I talked a bit about why the RWlock pattern is important for
accessing data, which is why Rust enforces this pattern either at compile time or runtime
depending on the abstractions used.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that there are many such abstractions in Rust, each with their unique guarantees.
The programmer once again has the choice between runtime and compile time enforcement. It occurred
to me that this plethora of &ldquo;wrapper types&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> could be daunting to newcomers; in this post I intend
to give a thorough explanation of what some prominent ones do and when they should be used.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming the reader knows about <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">ownership</a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrowing</a> in Rust.
Nevertheless, I will attempt to keep the majority of this post accessible to those not yet familiar with these
concepts. Aside from the two links into the book above, <a href="http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/">these</a> <a href="http://arthurtw.github.io/2014/11/30/rust-borrow-lifetimes.html">two</a> blog posts cover
the topic in depth.</p>

<h1>Basic pointer types</h1>

<h2><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is an &ldquo;owned pointer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;box&rdquo;. While it can hand out borrowed references to the data, it is the only
owner of the data. In particular, when something like the following occurs:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Box</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// x no longer accessible here</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here, the box was <em>moved</em> into <code>y</code>. As <code>x</code> no longer owns it,
the compiler will no longer allow the programmer to use <code>x</code> after this. A box
can similarly be moved <em>out</em> of a function by returning, and when a
box (one which hasn&rsquo;t been moved) goes out of scope, destructors are run, deallocating
the inner data.</p>

<p>This abstraction is a low cost abstraction for dynamic allocation. If you want
to allocate some memory on the heap and safely pass a pointer to that memory around, this
is ideal. Note that you will only be allowed to share borrowed references to this by
the regular borrowing rules, checked at compile time.</p>

<h4>Interlude: <code>Copy</code></h4>

<p>Move/ownership semantics are not special to <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>; it is a feature of all types which are not <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>Copy</code> type is one where all the data it logically encompasses (usually, owns) is part of its stack
representation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Most types containing pointers to other data are not <code>Copy</code>, since there is additional data
elsewhere, and simply copying the stack representation may accidentally share ownership of that data
in an unsafe manner.</p>

<p>Types like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>String</code> which also have data on the heap are also not <code>Copy</code>. Types
like the integer/boolean types are <code>Copy</code></p>

<p><code>&amp;T</code> and raw pointers <em>are</em> <code>Copy</code>. Even though they do point
to further data, they do not &ldquo;own&rdquo; that data. Whereas <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> can be thought of as
&ldquo;some data which happens to be dynamically allocated&rdquo;, <code>&amp;T</code> is thought of as &ldquo;a borrowing reference
to some data&rdquo;. Even though both are pointers, only the first is considered to be &ldquo;data&rdquo;. Hence,
a copy of the first should involve a copy of the data (which is not part of its stack representation),
but a copy of the second only needs a copy of the reference. <code>&amp;mut T</code> is not <code>Copy</code> because mutable aliases
cannot be shared, and <code>&amp;mut T</code> &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the data it points to somewhat since it can mutate.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, a type can be <code>Copy</code> if a copy of its stack representation doesn&rsquo;t violate
memory safety.</p>

<h2><code>&amp;T</code> and <code>&amp;mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are immutable and mutable references respectively. They follow the &ldquo;read-write lock&rdquo; pattern
described in my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a>, such that one may either have only one mutable reference
to some data, or any number of immutable ones, but not both. This guarantee is enforced at compile time,
and has no visible cost at runtime. In most cases such pointers suffice for sharing cheap references between
sections of code.</p>

<p>These pointers cannot be copied in such a way that they outlive the lifetime associated with them.</p>

<h2><code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are C-like raw pointers with no lifetime or ownership attached to them. They just point to some location
in memory with no other restrictions. The only guarantee that these provide is that they cannot be dereferenced
except in code marked <code>unsafe</code>.</p>

<p>These are useful when building safe, low cost abstractions like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but should be avoided in safe code.</p>

<h2><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p>This is the first wrapper we will cover that has a runtime cost.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a reference counted pointer. In other words, this lets us have multiple &ldquo;owning&rdquo; pointers
to the same data, and the data will be freed (destructors will be run) when all pointers are out of scope.</p>

<p>Internally, it contains a shared &ldquo;reference count&rdquo;, which is incremented each time the <code>Rc</code> is cloned, and decremented
each time one of the <code>Rc</code>s goes out of scope. The main responsibility of <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is to ensure that destructors are called
for shared data.</p>

<p>The internal data here is immutable, and if a cycle of references is created, the data will be leaked. If we want
data that doesn&rsquo;t leak when there are cycles, we need a <em>garbage collector</em>. I do not know of any existing GCs in Rust,
but <a href="http://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc">I am working on one with Nika Layzell</a> and there&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/rajan-bacon-cc">another cycle collecting one</a> being written by Nick
Fitzgerald.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>The main guarantee provided here is that the data will not be destroyed until all references to it are out of scope.</p>

<p>This should be used when you wish to dynamically allocate and share some data (read-only) between various portions
of your program, where it is not certain which portion will finish using the pointer last. It&rsquo;s a viable alternative
to <code>&amp;T</code> when <code>&amp;T</code> is either impossible to statically check for correctness, or creates extremely unergonomic code where
the programmer does not wish to spend the development cost of working with.</p>

<p>This pointer is <em>not</em> thread safe, and Rust will not let it be sent or shared with other threads. This lets
one avoid the cost of atomics in situations where they are unnecessary.</p>

<p>There is a sister smart pointer to this one, <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is a non-owning, but also non-borrowed, smart pointer.
It is also similar to <code>&amp;T</code>, but it is not restricted in lifetime &mdash; a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> can be held on to forever. However,
it is possible that an attempt to access the inner data may fail and return <code>None</code>, since this can outlive the owned
<code>Rc</code>s. This is useful for when one wants cyclic data structures and other things.</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>As far as memory goes, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is a single allocation, though it will allocate two extra words as compared to
a regular <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> (for &ldquo;strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak&rdquo; refcounts).</p>

<p><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> has the computational cost of incrementing/decrementing the refcount whenever it is cloned or goes out of
scope respectively. Note that a clone will not do a deep copy, rather it will simply increment the inner reference count
and return a copy of the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<h1>Cell types</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Cells&rdquo; provide interior mutability. In other words, they contain data which can be manipulated even
if the type cannot be obtained in a mutable form (for example, when it is behind an <code>&amp;</code>-ptr or <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/">The documentation for the <code>cell</code> module has a pretty good explanation for these</a>.</p>

<p>These types are <em>generally</em> found in struct fields, but they may be found elsewhere too.</p>

<h2><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a type that provides zero-cost interior mutability, but only for <code>Copy</code> types.
Since the compiler knows that all the data owned by the contained value is on the stack, there&rsquo;s
no worry of leaking any data behind references (or worse!) by simply replacing the data.</p>

<p>It is still possible to violate your own invariants using this wrapper, so be careful when
using it. If a field is wrapped in <code>Cell</code>, it&rsquo;s a nice indicator that the chunk of data is mutable
and may not stay the same between the time you first read it and when you intend to use it.</p>

<p>Note that here we were able to mutate the same value from various immutable references.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>but it has the added benefit of actually compiling successfully.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>This relaxes the &ldquo;no aliasing with mutability&rdquo; restriction in places where it&rsquo;s
unnecessary. However, this also relaxes the guarantees that the restriction provides;
so if one&rsquo;s invariants depend on data stored within <code>Cell</code>, one should be careful.</p>

<p>This is useful for mutating primitives and other <code>Copy</code> types when there is no easy way of
doing it in line with the static rules of <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/378tj6/blog_post_review_requested_container_types/crlfl74">Gábor Lehel</a> summed up the guarantees provided by <code>Cell</code> in a rather succinct manner:</p>

<blockquote><p>The basic guarantee we need to ensure is that interior references can&rsquo;t be invalidated (left dangling)
by mutation of the outer structure. (Think about references to the interiors of types like <code>Option</code>,
<code>Box</code>, <code>Vec</code>, etc.) <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, and Cell each make a different tradeoff here.
<code>&amp;</code> allows shared interior references but forbids mutation;
<code>&amp;mut</code> allows mutation xor interior references but not sharing;
<code>Cell</code> allows shared mutability but not interior references.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, while shared mutability can cause many logical errors (as outlined in <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">my previous post
</a>), it can only cause memory safety errors when coupled with &ldquo;interior references&rdquo;. This
is for types who have an &ldquo;interior&rdquo; whose type/size can itself be changed. One example of this is a
Rust enum; where by changing the variant you can change what type is contained. If you have an alias
to the inner type whilst the variant is changed, pointers within that alias may be invalidated.
Similarly, if you change the length of a vector while you have an alias to one of its elements, that
alias may be invalidated.</p>

<p>Since <code>Cell</code> doesn&rsquo;t allow references to the insides of a type (you can only copy out and copy back
in), enums and structs alike are safe to be aliased mutably within this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/32ypxp/questions_about_mutability/cqfwl3h">This comment by Eddy also touches on the guarantees of <code>Cell</code> and the alternatives</a></p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>There is no runtime cost to using <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, however if one is using it
to wrap larger (<code>Copy</code>) structs, it might be worthwhile to instead wrap individual
fields in <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> since each write is a full copy of the struct.</p>

<h2><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> also provides interior mutability, but isn&rsquo;t restricted to <code>Copy</code> types.</p>

<p>Instead, it has a runtime cost. <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> enforces the RWLock pattern at runtime (it&rsquo;s like a single-threaded mutex),
unlike <code>&amp;T</code>/<code>&amp;mut T</code> which do so at compile time. This is done by the <code>borrow()</code> and
<code>borrow_mut()</code> functions, which modify an internal reference count and return smart pointers
which can be dereferenced immutably and mutably respectively. The refcount is restored
when the smart pointers go out of scope. With this system, we can dynamically ensure that
there are never any other borrows active when a mutable borrow is active. If the programmer
attempts to make such a borrow, the thread will panic.</p>

<p>Similar to <code>Cell</code>, this is mainly useful for situations where it&rsquo;s hard or impossible to satisfy the
borrow checker. Generally one knows that such mutations won&rsquo;t happen in a nested form, but it&rsquo;s good
to check.</p>

<p>For large, complicated programs, it becomes useful to put some things in <code>RefCell</code>s to
make things simpler. For example, a lot of the maps in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/620d1ee5346bee10ba7ce129b2e20d6e59f0377d/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs#L803-L987">the <code>ctxt</code> struct</a> in the rust compiler
internals are inside this wrapper. These are only modified once (during creation, which is not
right after initialization) or a couple of times in well-separated places. However, since this struct is
pervasively used everywhere, juggling mutable and immutable pointers would be hard (perhaps impossible)
and probably form a soup of <code>&amp;</code>-ptrs which would be hard to extend. On the other hand, the <code>RefCell</code>
provides a cheap (not zero-cost) way of safely accessing these. In the future, if someone adds some code
that attempts to modify the cell when it&rsquo;s already borrowed, it will cause a (usually deterministic) panic
which can be traced back to the offending borrow.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Servo&rsquo;s DOM we have a lot of mutation, most of which is local to a DOM type, but
some of which crisscrosses the DOM and modifies various things. Using <code>RefCell</code> and <code>Cell</code> to guard
all mutation lets us avoid worrying about mutability everywhere, and it simultaneously
highlights the places where mutation is <em>actually</em> happening.</p>

<p>Note that <code>RefCell</code> should be avoided if a mostly simple solution is possible with <code>&amp;</code> pointers.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p><code>RefCell</code> relaxes the <em>static</em> restrictions preventing aliased mutation, and
replaces them with <em>dynamic</em> ones. As such the guarantees have not changed.</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p><code>RefCell</code> does not allocate, but it contains an additional &ldquo;borrow state&rdquo;
indicator (one word in size) along with the data.</p>

<p>At runtime each borrow causes a modification/check of the refcount.</p>

<h1>Synchronous types</h1>

<p>Many of the types above cannot be used in a threadsafe manner. Particularly, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>,
which both use non-atomic ref counts, cannot be used this way. This makes them cheaper to use, but one
needs thread safe versions of these too. They exist, in the form of <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>RWLock&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that the non-threadsafe types <em>cannot</em> be sent between threads, and this is checked at compile time.
I&rsquo;ll touch on how this is done in a later blog post.</p>

<p>There are many useful wrappers for concurrent programming in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/index.html">sync</a> module, but I&rsquo;m only going to cover
the major ones.</p>

<h2><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is just a version of <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that uses an atomic reference count (hence, &ldquo;Arc&rdquo;). This can be sent
freely between threads.</p>

<p>C++&rsquo;s <code>shared_ptr</code> is similar to <code>Arc</code>, however in C++s case the inner data is always mutable. For semantics
similar to that from C++, we should use <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, or <code>Arc&lt;UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> (<code>UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
is a cell type that can be used to hold any data and has no runtime cost, but accessing it requires <code>unsafe</code> blocks).
The last one should only be used if one is certain that the usage won&rsquo;t cause any memory unsafety. Remember that
writing to a struct is not an atomic operation, and many functions like <code>vec.push()</code> can reallocate internally
and cause unsafe behavior (so even monotonicity<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> may not be enough to justify <code>UnsafeCell</code>)</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>Like <code>Rc</code>, this provides the (thread safe) guarantee that the destructor for the internal data
will be run when the last <code>Arc</code> goes out of scope (barring any cycles).</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>This has the added cost of using atomics for changing the refcount (which will happen whenever it is cloned
or goes out of scope). When sharing data from an <code>Arc</code> in
a single thread, it is preferable to share <code>&amp;</code> pointers whenever possible.</p>

<h2><code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provide mutual-exclusion via RAII guards. For both of these, the
mutex is opaque until one calls <code>lock()</code> on it, at which point the thread will
block until a lock can be acquired, and then a guard will be returned. This guard
can be used to access the inner data (mutably), and the lock will be released when the
guard goes out of scope.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>RwLock</code> has the added benefit of being efficient for multiple reads. It is always
safe to have multiple readers to shared data as long as there are no writers; and <code>RwLock</code>
lets readers acquire a &ldquo;read lock&rdquo;. Such locks can be acquired concurrently and are kept track of
via a reference count. Writers must obtain a &ldquo;write lock&rdquo; which can only be obtained when all readers
have gone out of scope.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>Both of these provide safe shared mutability across threads, however they are prone to deadlocks.
Some level of additional protocol safety can be obtained via the type system. An example
of this is <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-sessions</a>, an experimental library which uses session
types for protocol safety.</p>

<h4>Costs</h4>

<p>These use internal atomic-like types to maintain the locks, and these are similar pretty
costly (they can block all memory reads across processors till they&rsquo;re done). Waiting on these locks
can also be slow when there&rsquo;s a lot of concurrent access happening.</p>

<h1>Composition</h1>

<p>A common gripe when reading Rust code is with stuff like <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and more complicated
compositions of such types.</p>

<p>Usually, it&rsquo;s a case of composing together the guarantees that one needs, without paying for stuff that is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>For example, <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> is one such composition. <code>Rc</code> itself can&rsquo;t be dereferenced mutably;
because <code>Rc</code> provides sharing and shared mutability isn&rsquo;t good, so we put <code>RefCell</code> inside to get
dynamically verified shared mutability. Now we have shared mutable data, but it&rsquo;s shared in a way
that there can only be one mutator (and no readers) or multiple readers.</p>

<p>Now, we can take this a step further, and have <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>Rc&lt;Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
These are both shareable, mutable vectors, but they&rsquo;re not the same.</p>

<p>With the former, the <code>RefCell</code> is wrapping the <code>Vec</code>, so the <code>Vec</code> in its entirety is mutable.
At the same time, there can only be one mutable borrow of the whole <code>Vec</code> at a given time. This
means that your code cannot simultaneously work on different elements of the vector from different
<code>Rc</code> handles. However, we are able to push and pop from the <code>Vec</code> at will. This is similar to an <code>&amp;mut Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
with the borrow checking done at runtime.</p>

<p>With the latter, the borrowing is of individual elements, but the overall vector is immutable.
Thus, we can independently borrow separate elements, but we cannot push or pop from the vector.
This is similar to an <code>&amp;mut [T]</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, but, again, the borrow checking is at runtime.</p>

<p>In concurrent programs, we have a similar situation with <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, which provides shared
mutability and ownership.</p>

<p>When reading code that uses these, go in step by step and look at the guarantees/costs provided.</p>

<p>When choosing a composed type, we must do the reverse; figure out which guarantees we want, and at which
point of the composition we need them. For example, if there is a choice between <code>Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,
we should figure out the tradeoffs as done above and pick one.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;stack representation&rdquo; I mean the data on the stack when a value of this type is held on the stack.

<p>This is a post that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for a while now; and the release of Rust 1.0 gives
me the perfect impetus to go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>Whilst this post discusses a choice made in the design of Rust; and uses examples in Rust; the principles discussed
here apply to other languages for the most part. I&rsquo;ll also try to make the post easy to understand for those without
a Rust background; please let me know if some code or terminology needs to be explained.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m going to discuss here is the choice made in Rust to disallow having multiple mutable aliases
to the same data (or a mutable alias when there are active immutable aliases),
<strong>even from the same thread</strong>. In essence, it disallows one from doing things like:</p>

<p>This is essentially the &ldquo;Read-Write lock&rdquo; (RWLock) pattern, except it&rsquo;s not being used in a
threaded context, and the &ldquo;locks&rdquo; are done via static analysis (compile time &ldquo;borrow checking&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Newcomers to the language have the recurring question as to why this exists. <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ownership.html">Ownership semantics</a>
and immutable <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrows</a> can be grasped because there are concrete examples from languages like C++ of
problems that these concepts prevent. It makes sense that having only one &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and then multiple &ldquo;borrowers&rdquo; who
are statically guaranteed to not stick around longer than the owner will prevent things like use-after-free.</p>

<p>But what could possibly be wrong with having multiple handles for mutating an object? Why do we need an RWLock pattern? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>It causes memory unsafety</h2>

<p>This issue is specific to Rust, and I promise that this will be the only Rust-specific answer.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/enums.html">Rust enums</a> provide a form of algebraic data types. A Rust enum is allowed to &ldquo;contain&rdquo; data,
for example you can have the enum</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">StringOrInt</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">Int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">i64</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which gives us a type that can either be a variant <code>Str</code>, with an associated string, or a variant <code>Int</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, with an associated integer.</p>

<p>With such an enum, we could cause a segfault like so:</p>

<p>Here, we invalidated the <code>insides</code> reference because setting <code>x</code> to <code>Int(1)</code> meant that there is no longer a string inside it.
However, <code>insides</code> is still a reference to a <code>String</code>, and the generated assembly would try to dereference the memory location where
the pointer to the allocated string <em>was</em>, and probably end up trying to dereference <code>1</code> or some nearby data instead, and cause a segfault.</p>

<p>Okay, so far so good. We know that for Rust-style enums to work safely in Rust, we need the RWLock pattern. But are there any other
reasons we need the RWLock pattern? Not many languages have such enums, so this shouldn&rsquo;t really be a problem for them.</p>

<h2>Iterator invalidation</h2>

<p>Ah, the example that is brought up almost every time the question above is asked. While I&rsquo;ve been quite guilty of
using this example often myself (and feel that it is a very appropriate example that can be quickly explained),
I also find it to be a bit of a cop-out, for reasons which I will explain below. This is partly why I&rsquo;m writing
this post in the first place; a better idea of the answer to The Question should be available for those who want
to dig deeper.</p>

<p>Iterator invalidation involves using tools like iterators whilst modifying the underlying dataset somehow.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">buf</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Firstly, this will loop infinitely (if it compiled, which it doesn&rsquo;t, because Rust prevents this). The
equivalent C++ example would be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5638323/modifying-a-data-structure-while-iterating-over-it">this one</a>, which I <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/Presentations/Rust/#/1/2">use</a> at every opportunity.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening in both code snippets is that the iterator is really just a pointer to the vector and an index.
It doesn&rsquo;t contain a snapshot of the original vector; so pushing to the original vector will make the iterator iterate for
longer. Pushing once per iteration will obviously make it iterate forever.</p>

<p>The infinite loop isn&rsquo;t even the real problem here. The real problem is that after a while, we could get a segmentation fault.
Internally, vectors have a certain amount of allocated space to work with. If the vector is grown past this space,
a new, larger allocation may need to be done (freeing the old one), since vectors must use contiguous memory.</p>

<p>This means that when the vector overflows its capacity, it will reallocate, invalidating the reference stored in the
iterator, and causing use-after-free.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a trivial solution in this case &mdash; store a reference to the <code>Vec</code>/<code>vector</code> object inside
the iterator instead of just the pointer to the vector on the heap. This leads to some extra indirection or a larger
stack size for the iterator (depending on how you implement it), but overall will prevent the memory unsafety.</p>

<p>This would still cause problems with more complex situations involving multidimensional vectors, however.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s effectively threaded&rdquo;</h2>

<blockquote><p>Aliasing with mutability in a sufficiently complex, single-threaded program is effectively the same thing as
accessing data shared across multiple threads without a lock</p></blockquote>

<p><s>(The above is my paraphrasing of someone else&rsquo;s quote; but I can&rsquo;t find the original or remember who made it)</s></p>

<p>Edit (Jan 2017): I found the original, it&rsquo;s a comment by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2x0h17/whats_your_killer_rust_feature/cow3zod/">kmc</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>My intuition is that code far away from my code <em>might as well be in another thread</em>,
for all I can reason about what it will do to shared mutable state.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step back a bit and figure out why we need locks in multithreaded programs. The way caches and memory work;
we&rsquo;ll never need to worry about two processes writing to the same memory location simultaneously and coming up with
a hybrid value, or a read happening halfway through a write.</p>

<p>What we do need to worry about is the rug being pulled out underneath our feet. A bunch of related reads/writes
would have been written with some invariants in mind, and arbitrary reads/writes possibly happening between them
would invalidate those invariants. For example, a bit of code might first read the length of a vector, and then go ahead
and iterate through it with a regular for loop bounded on the length.
The invariant assumed here is the length of the vector. If <code>pop()</code> was called on the vector in some other thread, this invariant could be
invalidated after the read to <code>length</code> but before the reads elsewhere, possibly causing a segfault or use-after-free in the last iteration.</p>

<p>However, we can have a situation similar to this (in spirit) in single threaded code. Consider the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">some_big_thing</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">some_vec</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">len</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">len</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">do_something_complicated</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">some_vec</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We have the same invariant here; but can we be sure that <code>x.do_something_complicated()</code> doesn&rsquo;t modify <code>x.some_vec</code> for
some reason? In a complicated codebase, where <code>do_something_complicated()</code> itself calls a lot of other functions which may
also modify <code>x</code>, this can be hard to audit.</p>

<p>Of course, the above example is a simplification and contrived; but it doesn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable to assume that such
bugs can happen in large codebases &mdash; where many methods being called have side effects which may not always be evident.</p>

<p>Which means that in large codebases we have almost the same problem as threaded ones. It&rsquo;s very hard to maintain invariants
when one is not completely sure of what each line of code is doing. It&rsquo;s possible to become sure of this by reading through the code
(which takes a while), but further modifications may also have to do the same. It&rsquo;s impractical to do this all the time and eventually
bugs will start cropping up.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having a static guarantee that this can&rsquo;t happen is great. And when the code is too convoluted for
a static guarantee (or you just want to avoid the borrow checker), a single-threaded RWlock-esque type called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a>
is available in Rust. It&rsquo;s a type providing interior mutability and behaves like a runtime version of the borrow checker.
Similar wrappers can be written in other languages.</p>

<p>Edit: In case of many primitives like simple integers, the problems with shared mutability turn out to not be a major issue.
For these, we have a type called <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cell/struct.Cell.html">Cell</a> which lets these be mutated and shared simultaenously. This works on all <code>Copy</code>
types; i.e. types which only need to be copied on the stack to be copied. (Unlike types involving pointers or other indirection)</p>

<p>This sort of bug is a good source of reentrancy problems too.</p>

<h2>Safe abstractions</h2>

<p>In particular, the issue in the previous section makes it hard to write safe abstractions, especially with generic code.
While this problem is clearer in the case of Rust (where abstractions are expected to be safe and preferably low-cost),
this isn&rsquo;t unique to any language.</p>

<p>Every method you expose has a contract that is expected to be followed. Many times, a contract is handled by type safety itself,
or you may have some error-based model to throw out uncontractual data (for example, division by zero).</p>

<p>But, as an API (can be either internal or exposed) gets more complicated, so does the contract. It&rsquo;s not always possible to verify that the contract is being violated
at runtime either, for example many cases of iterator invalidation are hard to prevent in nontrivial code even with asserts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to create a method and add documentation &ldquo;the first two arguments should not point to the same memory&rdquo;.
But if this method is used by other methods, the contract can change to much more complicated things that are harder to express
or check. When generics get involved, it only gets worse; you sometimes have no way of forcing that there are no shared mutable aliases,
or of expressing what isn&rsquo;t allowed in the documentation. Nor will it be easy for an API consumer to enforce this.</p>

<p>This makes it harder and harder to write safe, generic abstractions. Such abstractions rely on invariants, and these invariants can often
be broken by the problems in the previous section. It&rsquo;s not always easy to enforce these invariants, and such abstractions will either
be misused or not written in the first place, opting for a heavier option. Generally one sees that such abstractions or patterns are avoided
altogether, even though they may provide a performance boost, because they are risky and hard to maintain. Even if the present version of
the code is correct, someone may change something in the future breaking the invariants again.</p>

<p><a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/">My previous post</a> outlines a situation where Rust was able to choose
the lighter path in a situation where getting the same guarantees would be hard in C++.</p>

<p>Note that this is a wider problem than just with mutable aliasing. Rust has this problem too, but not when it comes to mutable aliasing.
Mutable aliasing is important to fix however, because we can make a lot of assumptions about our program when there are no mutable aliases.
Namely, by looking at a line of code we can know what happened wrt the locals. If there is the possibility of mutable aliasing out there; there&rsquo;s the
possibility that other locals were modified too. A very simple example is:</p>

<p>In both cases, when the two references are the same<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, instead of swapping, the two variables get set to zero.
A user (internal to your library, or an API consumer) would expect <code>swap()</code> to not change anything when fed equal
references, but this is doing something totally different. This assumption could get used in a program; for example instead
of skipping the passes in an array sort where the slot is being compared with itself, one might just go ahead with it
because <code>swap()</code> won&rsquo;t change anything there anyway; but it does, and suddenly your sort function fills everything with
zeroes. This could be solved by documenting the precondition and using asserts, but the documentation gets harder and harder
as <code>swap()</code> is used in the guts of other methods.</p>

<p>Of course, the example above was contrived. It&rsquo;s well known that those <code>swap()</code> implementations have that precondition,
and shouldn&rsquo;t be used in such cases. Also, in most swap algorithms it&rsquo;s trivial to ignore cases when you&rsquo;re comparing
an element with itself, generally done by bounds checking.</p>

<p>But the example is a simplified sketch of the problem at hand.</p>

<p>In Rust, since this is statically checked, one doesn&rsquo;t worry much about these problems, and
robust APIs can be designed since knowing when something won&rsquo;t be mutated can help simplify
invariants.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Aliasing that doesn&rsquo;t fit the RWLock pattern is dangerous. If you&rsquo;re using a language like
Rust, you don&rsquo;t need to worry. If you&rsquo;re using a language like C++, it can cause memory unsafety,
so be very careful. If you&rsquo;re using a language like Java or Go, while it can&rsquo;t cause memory unsafety,
it will cause problems in complex bits of code.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that this problem should force you to switch to Rust, either. If you feel that you
can avoid writing APIs where this happens, that is a valid way to go around it. This problem is much
rarer in languages with a GC, so you might be able to avoid it altogether without much effort. It&rsquo;s
also okay to use runtime checks and asserts to maintain your invariants; performance isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>

<p>But this <em>is</em> an issue in programming; and make sure you think of it when designing your code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I was working on a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25027">small feature</a>
for the Rust compiler, and came across a situation which really showcased Rust&rsquo;s
awesomeness as a language.</p>

<p>There was a struct which was exposed to an API,
and I wished to give it access to a list of things known as &ldquo;attributes&rdquo;, where the list was <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html">a heap-allocated vector</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I have two ways of actually giving the struct access to a vector. I can either clone it (i.e. make a copy of its contents),
or use a reference (pointer) to it or its contents.</p>

<p>In a language like C++ there&rsquo;s only once choice in this situation; that is
to clone the vector<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In a large C++ codebase if I wished to use a pointer I would need to be sure that the vector
isn&rsquo;t deallocated by the time I&rsquo;m done with it, and more importantly, to be sure that no other code pushes to the vector (when a vector overflows its
capacity it will be reallocated, invalidating any other pointers to its contents).</p>

<p>For a smaller codebase this might be possible, but in this specific case it could have taken me a while to become sure of this.
The code was related to the &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; portion of compilation, where the AST is expanded to a bigger AST. A lot of things change and get
moved around, so it is reasonable to assume that it might not be possible to safely use it.
I would have had to find out where the vector is originally stored; all the entry points for the code I was
modifying, and make sure it isn&rsquo;t being mutated (not as hard in Rust, but I would
still need to muck around a large codebase). And then I would have to somehow make sure that nobody tries to mutate it
in the future. This is a task which I would not even consider trying in C++.</p>

<p>However, I had another option here, because this was Rust. In Rust I can store a reference to the contents of the vector
without fear of invalidation, since the compiler will prevent me from using the vector in a way that could cause unsafety.
Such a reference is known as a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html">slice</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst in C++ I would have to manually go through a lot of code to be sure of safety
(and even after all that be left with code that would be brittle to changes elsewhere
the codebase), in Rust the compiler can do this for me!</p>

<p>Being able to do this was important
&mdash; this code is called quite often for a regular compile, and all those
extra allocations could be heavy, especially given that this was a feature that would be used
by very few.</p>

<p>So first I started off by adding a field to the <code>FieldInfo</code> struct which was a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R285">slice of attributes</a>. Notice that I added a lifetime specifier, <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R273">the <code>'a</code></a> to the struct definition.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For those of you new to Rust, a lifetime is part of the type of a reference. It&rsquo;s related to the scope of the reference, and generally can be treated as
a generic parameter. So, for example, here, I have a <code>FieldInfo</code> with a lifetime parameter of <code>'a</code> where <code>'a</code> is the lifetime of the inner slice of attributes.
If I construct this struct with slices from different scopes, its type will be different each time. Lifetimes can get automatically cast depending on their context however,
and quite often they get elided away, so one doesn&rsquo;t need to specify them that much (aside from struct/enum definitions). You can find more information <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ownership.html#lifetimes">in the Rust book</a></p>

<p>I then updated code everywhere to pass the attributes from <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1440">their source</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1155">their destination</a> through the chained methods.</p>

<p>An important thing to note here is that none of the lifetime specifiers you see now in the commit were added when I did this. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1410">the return value
of <code>create_struct_pattern</code></a> was
<code>(P&lt;ast::Pat&gt;, Vec&lt;(Span, Option&lt;Ident&gt;, P&lt;Expr&gt;, &amp;[ast::Attribute])&gt;)</code> at this point, not <code>(P&lt;ast::Pat&gt;, Vec&lt;(Span, Option&lt;Ident&gt;, P&lt;Expr&gt;, &amp;'a [ast::Attribute])&gt;)</code>.
You can ignore the complicated types being passed around, for now just pretend that a slice of attributes was returned.</p>

<p>Now comes the magic. After these small changes necessary for the feature, I basically let the compiler do the rest of the work. See, at this point the code was wrong.
I had forgotten lifetime specifiers in places where they were important, and still wasn&rsquo;t sure if storing a reference would in fact be possible in the first place.
However, the compiler was smart enough to figure things out for me. It would tell me to add lifetime specifiers, and I would add them.</p>

<p>First, the compiler asked me to add <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R297">a lifetime to the <code>FieldInfo</code> parts of <code>SubstructureFields</code></a>. So, the following:</p>

<p>This needed to happen because elision doesn&rsquo;t work for structs and enums,
and besides, the compiler would need to know if the <code>&amp;ast::Variant</code> was supposed to be the same lifetime as the parameter of the <code>FieldInfo</code>s. I decided
to just use the existing <code>'a</code> parameter, which meant that yes, the <code>&amp;ast::Variant</code> was supposed to live just as long. I could also have opted to give the <code>FieldInfo</code>s
a different lifetime by adding a <code>'b</code> parameter, but I guessed that it would work this way too (knowing the origin of the fieldinfo and variant, and that implicit lifetime casting would
fix most issues that cropped up). I didn&rsquo;t need to think this out much, though &mdash; the compiler gave me a suggestion and I could simply copy it.</p>

<p>The next error was in <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1463"><code>create_enum_variant_pattern()</code></a>

<p>In this case, the code was uncomfortable with taking a slice of attributes out of an arbitrary <code>StructDef</code> reference and returning it. What if the <code>StructDef</code> doesn&rsquo;t live long enough?
Generally the compiler internally figures out the lifetimes necessary and uses them here, but if you have too many references there&rsquo;s no single way to make the fix.
In this case, the compiler suggested I add a <code>'a</code> to <code>&amp;StructDef</code> and the returned <code>&amp;[Attribute]</code>, and I did so. The <code>'a</code> lifetime was declared at <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/blob/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b/src/libsyntax/ext/deriving/generic/mod.rs#L379">the top of the impl</a>, so it was the lifetime parameter of <code>self</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This meant that the returned attribute of the function will
have a lifetime tied to <code>self</code> and the input <code>StructDef</code>, and due to this it cannot outlive the inputs, which is what we wanted in the first place. In essence, I took a bit of code that was doing:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Again, I didn&rsquo;t need to think this out much (I&rsquo;m only thinking it through now for this blog post). I followed the suggestion given to me by the compiler:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There were a couple of similar errors elsewhere that were caused by tying these two lifetimes together. Since these methods were chained, updating the lifetimes of a child method
would mean that I would have to now update the parent method which passes its arguments down to the children and returns a modification of its return value (and thus must now impose the
same restrictions on its own signature). All of this was done by just listening to the suggestions of the compiler (which all contain a function signature to try out). In <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R890">some cases</a> I introduced a <code>'b</code> lifetime, because tying it to <code>'a</code>
(the self lifetime parameter) was possibly too restrictive. All of this at the suggestion of the compiler.</p>

<p>While this all seems long and complicated, in reality it wasn&rsquo;t. I simply added the field to the initial struct, tried compiling a couple of times to figure out which code needed updating
to pass around the attributes, and then went through 3-4 more compilation attempts to fix the lifetimes. It didn&rsquo;t take long, and I didn&rsquo;t need to put much mental effort into it. I just
listened to the compiler, and it worked.</p>

<p>And now I trust completely that that code will not cause any segfaults due to attempted access of a destroyed or moved vector. And this is despite the fact that I <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t know
where that particular vector is modified or destroyed &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t explore that far because I didn&rsquo;t need to! (or want to :P)</p>

<p>And this is one place Rust really shines. It lets you do optimizations which you wouldn&rsquo;t dream of doing in C++. In fact, while the C++ way of looking at this problem
would probably be to just clone and move on, most Rust programmers would think of using slices as the default, and not even consider it an &ldquo;optimization&rdquo;. And again, this wasn&rsquo;t
with much cognitive overhead; I could just follow the compiler and it fixed everything for me.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Some people have pointed out that a shared pointer to the vector itself would work here too. This is correct, but a shared pointer also has a runtime overhead, and more importantly doesn&rsquo;t prevent iterator invalidation. I had no idea how the vector was being used elsewhere, so this was a risk I didn&rsquo;t want to take. Additionally, whilst a shared pointer to the vector itself is immune to the issue of the vector being moved, since this was an API, someone consuming the API might take a reference of an attribute and hold on to it long enough for it to become invalidated. This is something we can&rsquo;t have either &ndash; an API consumer should not have to worry about where the pointers will invalidate.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Note: This is not the lifetime of the reference <code>&amp;self</code>, which is the lifetime of the pointer (<code>&amp;'b self</code>), but the lifetime parameter of <code>self</code>, a <code>TraitDef&lt;'a&gt;</code>, which has a lifetime parameter for its child fields.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
