  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I set up my Raspberry Pi as a music server so that I could listen to music without
having to deal with keeping my laptop in a certain corner of the room.</p>

<p>After setting it all up, it occurred to me: “I can do much more with this!”.</p>

<p>Waking up to go to class in the morning is always a challenge for me. It’s not that I don’t wake up
— I often wake up, cancel all the alarms, and go back to bed. Half-asleep me somehow has the
skill to turn off alarms, but not the discipline of going to class<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I’ve tried those apps that
make you do math before you can cancel the alarm, and I’m able to do the math and go back to sleep
without fully waking up in the process (Hey, I’m a physics student; math is what we do!).</p>

<p>So I decided to create an alarm clock. Not just any alarm clock, the most overengineered alarm clock
I can think of.</p>

<p>It consists of the Pi connected to a speaker and kept in a hard-to-reach area of the room. The Pi is
on a DHCP network. Every night, I ssh to the Pi, set the volume to full, and run a script which,
using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">at</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mpg123</code>, will schedule jobs to run around the desired time of waking up. First,
there will be a few pieces of soothing music (either violin music or parts of the <em>Interstellar</em>
OST) run once or twice, a while before the time of waking up. Close to the time of waking up, there
are a bunch of jobs where each one will run a string of annoying music. In my case, it’s the
Minions’ banana song followed by Nyan Cat (I sometimes add more to this list).</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now, the soothing music gives asleep-me me a chance to surrender and wake up <em>before</em> the Nyan Cat
begins, and often fear of Nyan Cat is a pretty good motivator to wake up. If I don’t wake up to
the soft songs, the annoying ones invariably work.</p>

<p>At this stage I’m still pretty groggy and have the intense urge to go back to bed. However, turning
off the alarm isn’t simple. Since it’s in a hard to reach area of the room, I can’t just turn it
off. I need to get up, sit in my chair, and turn on the laptop (which is hibernated/suspended), and
kill it via ssh.</p>

<p>This needs me to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code> the network to find the Pi (I’m the only one on this subnet who uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>, so this just needs a port filter)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> into the Pi, remembering the password (I haven’t done this yet but I could further complicate things by changing the password often to reduce muscle-memory)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">killall mpg123</code> to kill the currently playing song</li>
  <li>Cancel the remaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">at</code> jobs. This can be done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atq</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atrm</code> for every job (tedious and long), or with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code>. If I’ve already fully woken up, I’m able to do the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code> one, otherwise half-asleep me ends up doing the brute-force one, which is enough manual typing to shake the remaining bits of sleepiness off.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this whole process, it’s pretty much guaranteed that I’m fully awake – there’s no going back now!</p>

<p>So far it’s worked pretty well (both when I’ve slept on time and when I haven’t). The first ten minutes after this I’m rather annoyed, but after that I’m happy I woke up. If half-asleep me
eventually gets the muscle memory to get past this process, I should probably be able to tweak it
to add more complexity or change the way it works.</p>

<p>Of course, having an arms race with oneself probably isn’t the best way to solve this problem. I
suspect I’ll go back to regular alarms in a month or so, but it’s a fun experiment for now.</p>

<p>However, by the time I’m done with this alarm clock, I’ll either be waking up on time, or I’ll be
able to Linux in my sleep, which is a win-win!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while now I’ve been quite interested in compilers and systems programming in general; and I
feel that an important feature of systems programming is that it’s relatively easy to figure out
what a line of code does (modulo optimizations) at the OS or hardware level<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Conversely, it’s
important to know how your tools work more than ever in systems programming. So when I see a
language feature I’m not familiar with, I’m interested in finding out how it works under the hood.</p>

<p>I’m not a C++ expert. I can work on C++ codebases, but I’m not anywhere near knowing all of the
features and nuances of C++. However, I am pretty good at Rust and understand a decent portion of
the compiler internals. This gives me a great perspective — I’ve not yet internalized most C++
features to take them for granted, and I’m well equipped to investigate these features.</p>

<p>Today I came across some C++ code similar to the following<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">SomeType</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">OtherType</span> <span class="n">baz</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">otherMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code piqued my interest. Specifically, the local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> stuff. I knew that when you have a
static like</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>static int FOO = 1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> is stored somewhere in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.data</code> section of the program. This is easily verified with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">THING</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xAAAA</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ g++ test.cpp -g
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601038.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601038
THING in section .data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is basically a part of the compiled program as it is loaded into memory.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> that is initialized with a function, it’s stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bss</code>
section, and initialized before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code>. Again, easily verified:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="n">cout</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="s">"bar called</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mh">0xFAFAFA</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">THING</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="n">cout</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="s">"main called</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./a.out 
bar called
main called
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601198.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601198
THING in section .bss
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also leave statics uninitialized (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static int THING;</code>) and they will be placed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bss</code><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now back to the original snippet:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">SomeType</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">OtherType</span> <span class="n">baz</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">otherMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Naïvely one might say that these are statics which are scoped locally to avoid name clashes. It’s
not much different from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static THING = bar()</code> aside from the fact that it isn’t a global
identifier.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t the case. What tipped me off was that this called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Env()</code>, and I wasn’t so sure
that the environment was guaranteed to be properly initialized and available before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> is
called <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Instead, these are statics which are initialized the first time the function is called.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>

 <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>

<p>Wait, “the first time the function is called”? <em>Alarm bells go off…</em> Surely there’s some cost to that! Let’s investigate.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gdb a.out

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The instruction at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+44</code> calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code>, and it seems to be surrounded by calls to some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard</code>
functions.</p>

<p>We can take a naïve guess at what this does: It probably just sets a hidden static flag on
initialization which ensures that it only runs once.</p>

<p>Of course, the actual solution isn’t as simple. It needs to avoid data races, handle errors, and
somehow take care of recursive initialization.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <a href="http://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#once-ctor">spec</a> and one <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">implementation</a>, found by searching for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard</code>.</p>

<p>Both of them show us the generated code for initializing things like local statics:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj_guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">first_byte</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Over here, to initialize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code> needs to be called, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code> calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo()</code> which needs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>
to be initialized, which again will call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code> (though this time it won’t recurse). If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> wasn’t
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> it would be fine, but now we have two calls trying to initialize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, and it’s unclear as
to which value should be used.</p>

<p>The implementation is pretty interesting. Before looking at the code my quick guess was that the
following would happen for local statics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj_guard</code> is a struct containing a mutex and a flag with three states:
“uninitialized”, “initializing”, and “initialized”. Alternatively, use an atomic state indicator.</li>
  <li>When we try to initialize for the first time, the mutex is locked, the flag is set
to “initializing”, the mutex is released, the value is initialized, and the flag is set to “initialized”.</li>
  <li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is “initialized”, don’t initialize again</li>
  <li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is “initializing”, throw some exception</li>
</ul>

<p>(We need the tristate flag because without it recursion would cause deadlocks)</p>

<p>I suppose that this implementation would work, though it’s not the one being used. The
<a href="https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/master/libc/bionic/__cxa_guard.cpp">implementation in bionic</a> (the Android version of the C stdlib) is similar; it
uses per-static atomics which indicate various states. However, it does not throw an exception when
we have a recursive initialization, it instead seems to deadlock<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. This is okay because the C++
spec says (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n2356/stmt.html#stmt.dcl">Section 6.7.4</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being initialized, the
behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the implementations in <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/guard.cc">gcc/libstdc++</a> (also <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">this version</a> of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcppabi</code> from Apple, which is a bit more readable) do something different. They use a global
recursive mutex to handle reentrancy. Recursive mutexes basically can be locked multiple times by a
single thread, but cannot be locked by another thread till the locking thread unlocks them the same
number of times. This means that recursion/reentrancy won’t cause deadlocks, but we still have one-
thread-at-a-time access. What these implementations do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard_object</code> is a set of two flags, one which indicates if the static is initialized,
and one which indicates that the static is being initialized (“in use”)</li>
  <li>If the object is initialized, do nothing (this doesn’t use mutexes and is cheap).
This isn’t exactly part of the implementation in the library, but is part of the generated code.</li>
  <li>If it isn’t initialized, acquire the global recursive lock</li>
  <li>If the object is initialized by the time the lock was acquired, unlock and return</li>
  <li>If not, check if the static is being initialized from the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard_object</code> flag. If it is
“in use”, throw an exception.</li>
  <li>If it wasn’t, mark the second flag of the static’s guard object as being “in use”</li>
  <li>Call the initialization function, bubble errors</li>
  <li>Unlock the global mutex</li>
  <li>Mark the second flag as “not in use”</li>
</ul>

<p>At any one time, only one thread will be in the process of running initialization routines, due to
the global recursive mutex. Since the mutex is recursive, a function (eg <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code>) used for
initializing local statics may itself use (different) local statics. Due to the “in use” flag, the
initialization of a local static may not recursively call its parent function without causing an
error.</p>

<p>This doesn’t need per-static atomics, and doesn’t deadlock, however it has the cost of a global
mutex which is called at most once per local static. In a highly threaded situation with lots of
such statics, one might want to reevaluate directly using local statics.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxxabi/blob/master/src/cxa_guard.cpp#L188">LLVM’s libcxxabi</a> is similar to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libstdc++</code> implementation, but instead of a recursive
mutex it uses a regular mutex (on non-ARM Apple systems) which is unlocked before
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard_acquire</code> exits and tests for reentrancy by noting the thread ID in the guard object
instead of the “in use” flag. Condvars are used for waiting for a thread to stop using an object. On
other platforms, it seems to deadlock, though I’m not sure.</p>

<p>So here we have a rather innocent-looking feature that has some hidden costs and pitfalls. But now I
can look at a line of code where this feature is being used, and have a good idea of what’s
happening there. One step closer to being a better systems programmer!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In every talk I have given till now, the question “how does Rust achieve thread safety?”
has invariably come up<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I usually just give an overview, but this provides a more comprehensive
explanation for those who are interested</em></p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/02/some-notes-on-send-and-sync/">Huon’s blog post on the same topic</a></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/">previous post</a> I touched a bit on the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code></a> trait. There are other such
“marker” traits in the standard library, and the ones relevant to this discussion are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>
and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>. I recommend reading that post if you’re not familiar with Rust wrapper types
like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a>, since I’ll be using them as examples throughout this post;
but the concepts explained here are largely independent.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this post, I’ll restrict thread safety to mean no data races or cross-thread
dangling pointers. Rust doesn’t aim to solve race conditions. However, there are projects which
utilize the type system to provide some form of extra safety, for example <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-
sessions</a> attempts to provide protocol safety using
session types.</p>

<p>These traits are auto-implemented using a feature called “opt in builtin traits”. So, for example,
if struct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> contains only <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> fields, it will also be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>, unless we
explicitly opt out using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impl !Sync for Foo {}</code>. Similarly, if struct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> contains at least one
non-<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> type, it will not be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> either, unless it explicitly opts in (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe
impl Sync for Foo {}</code>)</p>

<p>This means that, for example, a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a> for a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> type is itself
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>, but a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a> for a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> type will not be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>. This
pattern is quite powerful; it lets one use channels with non-threadsafe data in a single-threaded
context without requiring a separate “single threaded” channel abstraction.</p>

<p>At the same time, structs like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> which contain
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>/<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> fields have explicitly opted out of one or more of these because the
invariants they rely on do not hold in threaded situations.</p>

<p>It’s actually possible to design your own library with comparable thread safety guarantees outside
of the compiler — while these marker traits are specially treated by the compiler, the special
treatment is not necessary for their working. Any two opt-in builtin traits could be used here.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> have slightly differing meanings, but are very intertwined.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> types can be moved between threads without an issue. It answers the question
“if this variable were moved to another thread, would it still be valid for use?”.
Most objects which completely own their contained data qualify here. Notably, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> doesn’t
(since it is shared ownership). Another exception is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/thread/struct.LocalKey.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LocalKey</code></a>, which
<em>does</em> own its data but isn’t valid from other threads. Borrowed data does qualify to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>, but
in most cases it can’t be sent across threads due to a constraint that will be touched upon later.</p>

<p>Even though types like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> use non-atomic reference counting, it can be sent safely
between threads because this is a transfer of <em>ownership</em> (a move). Sending a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> to another thread
will be a move and will make it unusable from the original thread; so this is fine.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>, on the other hand, is about synchronous access. It answers the question: “if
multiple threads were all trying to access this data, would it be safe?”. Types like
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code></a> and other lock/atomic based types implement this, along with primitive types.
Things containing pointers generally are not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> is sort of a crutch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>; it helps make other types <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> when sharing is
involved. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> are only <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> when the inner data is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> (there’s an additional
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> bound in the case of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>). In words, stuff that has shared/borrowed ownership can be sent
to another thread if the shared/borrowed data is synchronous-safe.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a>, while <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>, is not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> because of the non atomic reference counting.</p>

<p>Bringing it together, the gatekeeper for all this is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thread::spawn()</code></a>. It has the signature</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">spawn</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">F</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">JoinHandle</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">FnOnce</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Send</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">'static</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Send</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">'static</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, this is confusing/noisy, partially because it’s allowed to return a value, and also because
it returns a handle from which we can block on a thread join. We can conjure a simpler <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spawn</code> API for our needs though:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">spawn</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">F</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">FnOnce</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Send</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">'static</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which can be called like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="c">// `move` instructs the closure to move out of its environment</span>
<span class="nn">thread</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">spawn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">move</span> <span class="p">||</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="c">// x is not accessible here since it was moved</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In words, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spawn()</code> will take a callable (usually a closure) that will be called once, and contains
data which is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>. Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> just means that there is no borrowed
data contained in the closure. This is the aforementioned constraint that prevents the sharing of
borrowed data across threads; without it we would be able to send a borrowed pointer to a thread that
could easily outlive the borrow, causing safety issues.</p>

<p>There’s a slight nuance here about the closures — closures can capture outer variables,
but by default they do so by-reference (hence the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move</code> keyword). They autoimplement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>
and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> depending on their capture clauses. For more on their internal representation,
see <a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/">huon’s post</a>. In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> was captured by-move; i.e. as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>
(instead of being similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> or something), so the closure itself can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>.
Without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move</code> keyword, the closure would not be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> since it contains borrowed
content.</p>

<p>Since the closure inherits the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>-ness of its captured data, a closure
capturing data of the correct type will satisfy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F: Send+'static</code> bound.</p>

<p>Some examples of things that are allowed and not allowed by this function (for the type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> are allowed because they are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> (when the inner type is of the same kind)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> isn’t allowed because it’s not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>. This is good, because borrows should have a statically-known lifetime. Sending a borrowed pointer to a thread may lead to a use after free, or otherwise break aliasing rules.</li>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> isn’t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>, so it isn’t allowed. We could have some other <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>s hanging around, and end up with a data race on the refcount.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;</code> is allowed (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> if the inner type is); we can’t cause a safety violation here. Iterator invalidation requires mutation, and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> doesn’t provide this by default.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> isn’t allowed. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provides copying-based internal mutability, and isn’t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> (so the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> isn’t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>). If this were allowed, we could have cases where larger structs are getting written to from different threads simultaneously resulting in some random mishmash of the two. In other words, a data race.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> are allowed (for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>). The inner types use threadsafe locks and provide lock-based internal mutability. They can guarantee that only one thread is writing to them at any point in time. For this reason, the mutexes are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> regardless of the inner <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> (as long as it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>), and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> types can be shared safely with wrappers like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code></a>. From the point of view of the inner type, it’s only being accessed by one thread at a time (slightly more complex in the case of <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code></a>), so it doesn’t need to know about the threads involved. There can’t be data races when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> types like these are involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, you can in fact create a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a>/<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Receiver</code></a> pair of non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> objects. This sounds a bit
counterintuitive — shouldn’t we be only sending values which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>? However, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is only
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>; so even if we can use a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a> of a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> type, we cannot send it to another thread,
so it cannot be used to violate thread safety.</p>

<p>There is also a way to utilize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>-ness of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> (which is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>) for some <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, namely <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.scoped.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thread::scoped</code></a>.
This function does not have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> bound, but it instead has an RAII guard which forces a join before the borrow ends. This
allows for easy fork-join parallelism without necessarily needing a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code></a>.
Sadly, there <a href="http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/everyone-peaches/">are</a> <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/04/29/on-reference-counting-and-leaks/">problems</a> which crop up when this interacts with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> cycles, so the API
is currently unstable and will be redesigned. This is not a problem with the language design or the design of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code>,
rather it is a perfect storm of small design inconsistencies in the libraries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More than a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">year ago</a> I blogged (and <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/04/50-more-shades-of-green.html">blogged again</a> later) about my
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth">ongoing github streak</a>.</p>

<p>The GitHub streak has since gone on for more than 500 days<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and has been a really enriching experience.</p>

<p>Yesterday; I noticed something. I had reached end-game with this exercise. The streak is something I don’t think about anymore,
and I don’t make any efforts to keep it going. It just … happens. My involvement in open source has reached a level where
I don’t need to consciously try contributing daily; I have enough interests/responsibilities that the streak is a side effect. This is despite
my current internship being at a place where the code I’m working on is not hosted on GitHub (unlike last year). If the streak breaks, I won’t
particularly care; and I <em>haven’t</em> been caring for a while now.</p>

<p>… I think that’s amazing. Despite me not realizing it at the time, this is the state of affairs that such an exercise would ideally
lead to — the initial motivation for the exercise replaced with something more substantial, until the excercise is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>I initially started this off after realizing that I had inadvertantly been contributing daily to open source for a week or so. In the past, my
contributions to open source used to be in bursts, which meant that I would be out of touch at times. I decided to try and work on extending this.
After around 30 days, I had a concrete habit. After around 40, I realized that I’d become much more efficient at working on random bugs (even in unfamiliar codebases),
thus being able to spend more time writing real code.</p>

<p>Initially I had set a bunch of rules (listed in my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">original post</a>), which had stuff like issues/readme edits not counting (and no date manipulation!). I tweaked the rules around the 80-mark
to include issues/readmes when I had written code that day but it was lost in a commit squash or rebase. I think much later I dropped the rules about issues and readme edits entirely;
just considering “anything that shows up on the punchcard which is not a result of date manipulation” to be valid. At that point I was already quite involved in multiple projects
and didn’t care so much about the streak or the original rules — it was just a habit at that point.</p>

<p>Now, I’m a regular contributor to both the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> projects. I also have a bunch of personal projects (<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-tenacious">lints</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-extensible">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-adorn">syntax extensions</a> for Rust, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">gc</a>, along with a lot of older projects that I don’t actively work on but maintain) and am trying to regularly blog. I’ve
also gotten well into the habit of sending pull requests for fixing mistakes or annoyances. When all this comes together, I end up with at least one contribution a day. Sometimes more.
I have tons of things queued that I want to work on (both personal and as a part of Servo/Rust/elsewhere), if only I had the time.</p>

<p>If you do have enough spare time, I do recommend trying this. Once you get enough momentum the power of habit will keep it going, and if
my case is anything of an indicator<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup> you’ll eventually have a good chunk of contributions and some concrete open source involvement.</p>

<p>Please note that GitHub streaks shouldn’t be used as a metric, <em>ever</em>. They’re great for self motivation. As a metric for tracking employee performance,
or for filtering interview candidates; not so much. It’s way too rough a metric (like LoC written), and oversimplifies the work that goes into code.
As far as using it to boost interview candidates; not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source after a day job in programming,
and <em>that’s okay</em>. I’m a physics student — programming is like a hobby for me<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> which I’ll gladly do daily. Now that I have a programming intern,
I’m pretty sure there will be days where I don’t want to program further after leaving the office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This post is now <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/choosing-your-guarantees.html">a part of the official rust book</a></em></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a> I talked a bit about why the RWlock pattern is important for
accessing data, which is why Rust enforces this pattern either at compile time or runtime
depending on the abstractions used.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that there are many such abstractions in Rust, each with their unique guarantees.
The programmer once again has the choice between runtime and compile time enforcement. It occurred
to me that this plethora of “wrapper types”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> could be daunting to newcomers; in this post I intend
to give a thorough explanation of what some prominent ones do and when they should be used.</p>

<p>I’m assuming the reader knows about <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">ownership</a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrowing</a> in Rust.
Nevertheless, I will attempt to keep the majority of this post accessible to those not yet familiar with these
concepts. Aside from the two links into the book above, <a href="http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/">these</a> <a href="http://arthurtw.github.io/2014/11/30/rust-borrow-lifetimes.html">two</a> blog posts cover
the topic in depth.</p>

<h1 id="basic-pointer-types">Basic pointer types</h1>

<h2 id="boxt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is an “owned pointer” or a “box”. While it can hand out borrowed references to the data, it is the only
owner of the data. In particular, when something like the following occurs:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Box</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c">// x no longer accessible here</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the box was <em>moved</em> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>. As <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> no longer owns it,
the compiler will no longer allow the programmer to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> after this. A box
can similarly be moved <em>out</em> of a function by returning, and when a
box (one which hasn’t been moved) goes out of scope, destructors are run, deallocating
the inner data.</p>

<p>This abstraction is a low cost abstraction for dynamic allocation. If you want
to allocate some memory on the heap and safely pass a pointer to that memory around, this
is ideal. Note that you will only be allowed to share borrowed references to this by
the regular borrowing rules, checked at compile time.</p>

<h4 id="interlude-copy">Interlude: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code></h4>

<p>Move/ownership semantics are not special to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>; it is a feature of all types which are not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>.</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> type is one where all the data it logically encompasses (usually, owns) is part of its stack
representation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Most types containing pointers to other data are not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>, since there is additional data
elsewhere, and simply copying the stack representation may accidentally share ownership of that data
in an unsafe manner.</p>

<p>Types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code> which also have data on the heap are also not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>. Types
like the integer/boolean types are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and raw pointers <em>are</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>. Even though they do point
to further data, they do not “own” that data. Whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> can be thought of as
“some data which happens to be dynamically allocated”, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> is thought of as “a borrowing reference
to some data”. Even though both are pointers, only the first is considered to be “data”. Hence,
a copy of the first should involve a copy of the data (which is not part of its stack representation),
but a copy of the second only needs a copy of the reference. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> because mutable aliases
cannot be shared, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> “owns” the data it points to somewhat since it can mutate.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, a type can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> if a copy of its stack representation doesn’t violate
memory safety.</p>

<h2 id="t-and-mut-t"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are immutable and mutable references respectively. They follow the “read-write lock” pattern
described in my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a>, such that one may either have only one mutable reference
to some data, or any number of immutable ones, but not both. This guarantee is enforced at compile time,
and has no visible cost at runtime. In most cases such pointers suffice for sharing cheap references between
sections of code.</p>

<p>These pointers cannot be copied in such a way that they outlive the lifetime associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="const-t-and-mut-t"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*const T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are C-like raw pointers with no lifetime or ownership attached to them. They just point to some location
in memory with no other restrictions. The only guarantee that these provide is that they cannot be dereferenced
except in code marked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code>.</p>

<p>These are useful when building safe, low cost abstractions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but should be avoided in safe code.</p>

<h2 id="rct"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p>This is the first wrapper we will cover that has a runtime cost.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a reference counted pointer. In other words, this lets us have multiple “owning” pointers
to the same data, and the data will be freed (destructors will be run) when all pointers are out of scope.</p>

<p>Internally, it contains a shared “reference count”, which is incremented each time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> is cloned, and decremented
each time one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>s goes out of scope. The main responsibility of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is to ensure that destructors are called
for shared data.</p>

<p>The internal data here is immutable, and if a cycle of references is created, the data will be leaked. If we want
data that doesn’t leak when there are cycles, we need a <em>garbage collector</em>. I do not know of any existing GCs in Rust,
but <a href="http://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc">I am working on one with Nika Layzell</a> and there’s <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/rajan-bacon-cc">another cycle collecting one</a> being written by Nick
Fitzgerald.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h4>

<p>The main guarantee provided here is that the data will not be destroyed until all references to it are out of scope.</p>

<p>This should be used when you wish to dynamically allocate and share some data (read-only) between various portions
of your program, where it is not certain which portion will finish using the pointer last. It’s a viable alternative
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> is either impossible to statically check for correctness, or creates extremely unergonomic code where
the programmer does not wish to spend the development cost of working with.</p>

<p>This pointer is <em>not</em> thread safe, and Rust will not let it be sent or shared with other threads. This lets
one avoid the cost of atomics in situations where they are unnecessary.</p>

<p>There is a sister smart pointer to this one, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is a non-owning, but also non-borrowed, smart pointer.
It is also similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code>, but it is not restricted in lifetime — a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> can be held on to forever. However,
it is possible that an attempt to access the inner data may fail and return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>, since this can outlive the owned
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>s. This is useful for when one wants cyclic data structures and other things.</p>

<h4 id="cost">Cost</h4>

<p>As far as memory goes, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is a single allocation, though it will allocate two extra words as compared to
a regular <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> (for “strong” and “weak” refcounts).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> has the computational cost of incrementing/decrementing the refcount whenever it is cloned or goes out of
scope respectively. Note that a clone will not do a deep copy, rather it will simply increment the inner reference count
and return a copy of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<h1 id="cell-types">Cell types</h1>

<p>“Cells” provide interior mutability. In other words, they contain data which can be manipulated even
if the type cannot be obtained in a mutable form (for example, when it is behind an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>-ptr or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/">The documentation for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cell</code> module has a pretty good explanation for these</a>.</p>

<p>These types are <em>generally</em> found in struct fields, but they may be found elsewhere too.</p>

<h2 id="cellt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a type that provides zero-cost interior mutability, but only for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types.
Since the compiler knows that all the data owned by the contained value is on the stack, there’s
no worry of leaking any data behind references (or worse!) by simply replacing the data.</p>

<p>It is still possible to violate your own invariants using this wrapper, so be careful when
using it. If a field is wrapped in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code>, it’s a nice indicator that the chunk of data is mutable
and may not stay the same between the time you first read it and when you intend to use it.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Cell</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">y</span><span class="nf">.set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">z</span><span class="nf">.set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.get</span><span class="p">());</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that here we were able to mutate the same value from various immutable references.</p>

<p>This has the same runtime cost as the following:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but it has the added benefit of actually compiling successfully.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-1">Guarantees</h4>

<p>This relaxes the “no aliasing with mutability” restriction in places where it’s
unnecessary. However, this also relaxes the guarantees that the restriction provides;
so if one’s invariants depend on data stored within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code>, one should be careful.</p>

<p>This is useful for mutating primitives and other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types when there is no easy way of
doing it in line with the static rules of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/378tj6/blog_post_review_requested_container_types/crlfl74">Gábor Lehel</a> summed up the guarantees provided by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> in a rather succinct manner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic guarantee we need to ensure is that interior references can’t be invalidated (left dangling)
by mutation of the outer structure. (Think about references to the interiors of types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>, etc.) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut</code>, and Cell each make a different tradeoff here.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> allows shared interior references but forbids mutation;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut</code> allows mutation xor interior references but not sharing;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> allows shared mutability but not interior references.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, while shared mutability can cause many logical errors (as outlined in <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">my previous post
</a>), it can only cause memory safety errors when coupled with “interior references”. This
is for types who have an “interior” whose type/size can itself be changed. One example of this is a
Rust enum; where by changing the variant you can change what type is contained. If you have an alias
to the inner type whilst the variant is changed, pointers within that alias may be invalidated.
Similarly, if you change the length of a vector while you have an alias to one of its elements, that
alias may be invalidated.</p>

<p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> doesn’t allow references to the insides of a type (you can only copy out and copy back
in), enums and structs alike are safe to be aliased mutably within this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/32ypxp/questions_about_mutability/cqfwl3h">This comment by Eddy also touches on the guarantees of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> and the alternatives</a></p>

<h4 id="cost-1">Cost</h4>

<p>There is no runtime cost to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, however if one is using it
to wrap larger (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>) structs, it might be worthwhile to instead wrap individual
fields in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> since each write is a full copy of the struct.</p>

<h2 id="refcellt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> also provides interior mutability, but isn’t restricted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types.</p>

<p>Instead, it has a runtime cost. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> enforces the RWLock pattern at runtime (it’s like a single-threaded mutex),
unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> which do so at compile time. This is done by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">borrow()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">borrow_mut()</code> functions, which modify an internal reference count and return smart pointers
which can be dereferenced immutably and mutably respectively. The refcount is restored
when the smart pointers go out of scope. With this system, we can dynamically ensure that
there are never any other borrows active when a mutable borrow is active. If the programmer
attempts to make such a borrow, the thread will panic.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">RefCell</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{:?}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.borrow</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="n">my_ref</span><span class="nf">.push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code>, this is mainly useful for situations where it’s hard or impossible to satisfy the
borrow checker. Generally one knows that such mutations won’t happen in a nested form, but it’s good
to check.</p>

<p>For large, complicated programs, it becomes useful to put some things in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code>s to
make things simpler. For example, a lot of the maps in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/620d1ee5346bee10ba7ce129b2e20d6e59f0377d/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs#L803-L987">the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctxt</code> struct</a> in the rust compiler
internals are inside this wrapper. These are only modified once (during creation, which is not
right after initialization) or a couple of times in well-separated places. However, since this struct is
pervasively used everywhere, juggling mutable and immutable pointers would be hard (perhaps impossible)
and probably form a soup of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>-ptrs which would be hard to extend. On the other hand, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code>
provides a cheap (not zero-cost) way of safely accessing these. In the future, if someone adds some code
that attempts to modify the cell when it’s already borrowed, it will cause a (usually deterministic) panic
which can be traced back to the offending borrow.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Servo’s DOM we have a lot of mutation, most of which is local to a DOM type, but
some of which crisscrosses the DOM and modifies various things. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> to guard
all mutation lets us avoid worrying about mutability everywhere, and it simultaneously
highlights the places where mutation is <em>actually</em> happening.</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> should be avoided if a mostly simple solution is possible with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> pointers.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-2">Guarantees</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> relaxes the <em>static</em> restrictions preventing aliased mutation, and
replaces them with <em>dynamic</em> ones. As such the guarantees have not changed.</p>

<h4 id="cost-2">Cost</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> does not allocate, but it contains an additional “borrow state”
indicator (one word in size) along with the data.</p>

<p>At runtime each borrow causes a modification/check of the refcount.</p>

<h1 id="synchronous-types">Synchronous types</h1>

<p>Many of the types above cannot be used in a threadsafe manner. Particularly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>,
which both use non-atomic ref counts, cannot be used this way. This makes them cheaper to use, but one
needs thread safe versions of these too. They exist, in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RWLock&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that the non-threadsafe types <em>cannot</em> be sent between threads, and this is checked at compile time.
I’ll touch on how this is done in a later blog post.</p>

<p>There are many useful wrappers for concurrent programming in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/index.html">sync</a> module, but I’m only going to cover
the major ones.</p>

<h2 id="arct"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is just a version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that uses an atomic reference count (hence, “Arc”). This can be sent
freely between threads.</p>

<p>C++’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared_ptr</code> is similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code>, however in C++s case the inner data is always mutable. For semantics
similar to that from C++, we should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
is a cell type that can be used to hold any data and has no runtime cost, but accessing it requires <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> blocks).
The last one should only be used if one is certain that the usage won’t cause any memory unsafety. Remember that
writing to a struct is not an atomic operation, and many functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec.push()</code> can reallocate internally
and cause unsafe behavior (so even monotonicity<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">4</a></sup> may not be enough to justify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UnsafeCell</code>)</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-3">Guarantees</h4>

<p>Like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>, this provides the (thread safe) guarantee that the destructor for the internal data
will be run when the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code> goes out of scope (barring any cycles).</p>

<h4 id="cost-3">Cost</h4>
<p>This has the added cost of using atomics for changing the refcount (which will happen whenever it is cloned
or goes out of scope). When sharing data from an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code> in
a single thread, it is preferable to share <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> pointers whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id="mutext-and-rwlockt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provide mutual-exclusion via RAII guards. For both of these, the
mutex is opaque until one calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lock()</code> on it, at which point the thread will
block until a lock can be acquired, and then a guard will be returned. This guard
can be used to access the inner data (mutably), and the lock will be released when the
guard goes out of scope.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">guard</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mutex</span><span class="nf">.lock</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c">// guard dereferences mutably to the inner type</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">guard</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="c">// lock released when destructor runs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code> has the added benefit of being efficient for multiple reads. It is always
safe to have multiple readers to shared data as long as there are no writers; and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code>
lets readers acquire a “read lock”. Such locks can be acquired concurrently and are kept track of
via a reference count. Writers must obtain a “write lock” which can only be obtained when all readers
have gone out of scope.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-4">Guarantees</h4>
<p>Both of these provide safe shared mutability across threads, however they are prone to deadlocks.
Some level of additional protocol safety can be obtained via the type system. An example 
of this is <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-sessions</a>, an experimental library which uses session
types for protocol safety.</p>

<h4 id="costs">Costs</h4>

<p>These use internal atomic-like types to maintain the locks, and these are similar pretty
costly (they can block all memory reads across processors till they’re done). Waiting on these locks
can also be slow when there’s a lot of concurrent access happening.</p>

<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>

<p>A common gripe when reading Rust code is with stuff like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and more complicated
compositions of such types.</p>

<p>Usually, it’s a case of composing together the guarantees that one needs, without paying for stuff that is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> is one such composition. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> itself can’t be dereferenced mutably;
because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> provides sharing and shared mutability isn’t good, so we put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> inside to get
dynamically verified shared mutability. Now we have shared mutable data, but it’s shared in a way
that there can only be one mutator (and no readers) or multiple readers.</p>

<p>Now, we can take this a step further, and have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
These are both shareable, mutable vectors, but they’re not the same.</p>

<p>With the former, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> is wrapping the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>, so the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code> in its entirety is mutable.
At the same time, there can only be one mutable borrow of the whole <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code> at a given time. This
means that your code cannot simultaneously work on different elements of the vector from different
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> handles. However, we are able to push and pop from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code> at will. This is similar to an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
with the borrow checking done at runtime.</p>

<p>With the latter, the borrowing is of individual elements, but the overall vector is immutable.
Thus, we can independently borrow separate elements, but we cannot push or pop from the vector.
This is similar to an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut [T]</code><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, but, again, the borrow checking is at runtime.</p>

<p>In concurrent programs, we have a similar situation with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, which provides shared
mutability and ownership.</p>

<p>When reading code that uses these, go in step by step and look at the guarantees/costs provided.</p>

<p>When choosing a composed type, we must do the reverse; figure out which guarantees we want, and at which
point of the composition we need them. For example, if there is a choice between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,
we should figure out the tradeoffs as done above and pick one.</p>

I suspect I subconsciously got the idea for this from that post, at least in part.</em></p>

<p>This is a post that I’ve been meaning to write for a while now; and the release of Rust 1.0 gives
me the perfect impetus to go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>Whilst this post discusses a choice made in the design of Rust; and uses examples in Rust; the principles discussed
here apply to other languages for the most part. I’ll also try to make the post easy to understand for those without
a Rust background; please let me know if some code or terminology needs to be explained.</p>

<p>What I’m going to discuss here is the choice made in Rust to disallow having multiple mutable aliases
to the same data (or a mutable alias when there are active immutable aliases),
<strong>even from the same thread</strong>. In essence, it disallows one from doing things like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Vec</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is essentially the “Read-Write lock” (RWLock) pattern, except it’s not being used in a
threaded context, and the “locks” are done via static analysis (compile time “borrow checking”).</p>

<p>Newcomers to the language have the recurring question as to why this exists. <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ownership.html">Ownership semantics</a>
and immutable <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrows</a> can be grasped because there are concrete examples from languages like C++ of
problems that these concepts prevent. It makes sense that having only one “owner” and then multiple “borrowers” who
are statically guaranteed to not stick around longer than the owner will prevent things like use-after-free.</p>

<p>But what could possibly be wrong with having multiple handles for mutating an object? Why do we need an RWLock pattern? <sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="it-causes-memory-unsafety">It causes memory unsafety</h2>

<p>This issue is specific to Rust, and I promise that this will be the only Rust-specific answer.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/enums.html">Rust enums</a> provide a form of algebraic data types. A Rust enum is allowed to “contain” data,
for example you can have the enum</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">StringOrInt</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nf">Int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">i64</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which gives us a type that can either be a variant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Str</code>, with an associated string, or a variant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Int</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, with an associated integer.</p>

<p>With such an enum, we could cause a segfault like so:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hi!"</span><span class="nf">.to_string</span><span class="p">());</span> <span class="c">// Create an instance of the `Str` variant with associated string "Hi!"</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">// Create a mutable alias to x</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nf">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">ref</span> <span class="n">insides</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c">// If x is a `Str`, assign its inner data to the variable `insides`</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c">// Set `*y` to `Int(1), therefore setting `x` to `Int(1)` too</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"x says: {}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">insides</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c">// Uh oh!</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we invalidated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insides</code> reference because setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Int(1)</code> meant that there is no longer a string inside it.
However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insides</code> is still a reference to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>, and the generated assembly would try to dereference the memory location where
the pointer to the allocated string <em>was</em>, and probably end up trying to dereference <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> or some nearby data instead, and cause a segfault.</p>

<p>Okay, so far so good. We know that for Rust-style enums to work safely in Rust, we need the RWLock pattern. But are there any other
reasons we need the RWLock pattern? Not many languages have such enums, so this shouldn’t really be a problem for them.</p>

<h2 id="iterator-invalidation">Iterator invalidation</h2>

<p>Ah, the example that is brought up almost every time the question above is asked. While I’ve been quite guilty of
using this example often myself (and feel that it is a very appropriate example that can be quickly explained),
I also find it to be a bit of a cop-out, for reasons which I will explain below. This is partly why I’m writing
this post in the first place; a better idea of the answer to The Question should be available for those who want
to dig deeper.</p>

<p>Iterator invalidation involves using tools like iterators whilst modifying the underlying dataset somehow.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">buf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">buf</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">buf</span><span class="nf">.push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Firstly, this will loop infinitely (if it compiled, which it doesn’t, because Rust prevents this). The
equivalent C++ example would be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5638323/modifying-a-data-structure-while-iterating-over-it">this one</a>, which I <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/Presentations/Rust/#/1/2">use</a> at every opportunity.</p>

<p>What’s happening in both code snippets is that the iterator is really just a pointer to the vector and an index.
It doesn’t contain a snapshot of the original vector; so pushing to the original vector will make the iterator iterate for
longer. Pushing once per iteration will obviously make it iterate forever.</p>

<p>The infinite loop isn’t even the real problem here. The real problem is that after a while, we could get a segmentation fault.
Internally, vectors have a certain amount of allocated space to work with. If the vector is grown past this space,
a new, larger allocation may need to be done (freeing the old one), since vectors must use contiguous memory.</p>

<p>This means that when the vector overflows its capacity, it will reallocate, invalidating the reference stored in the
iterator, and causing use-after-free.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a trivial solution in this case — store a reference to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector</code> object inside
the iterator instead of just the pointer to the vector on the heap. This leads to some extra indirection or a larger
stack size for the iterator (depending on how you implement it), but overall will prevent the memory unsafety.</p>

<p>This would still cause problems with more complex situations involving multidimensional vectors, however.</p>

<h2 id="its-effectively-threaded">“It’s effectively threaded”</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aliasing with mutability in a sufficiently complex, single-threaded program is effectively the same thing as
accessing data shared across multiple threads without a lock</p>
</blockquote>

<s>(The above is my paraphrasing of someone else's quote; but I can't find the original or remember who made it)</s>

<p>Edit (Jan 2017): I found the original, it’s a comment by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2x0h17/whats_your_killer_rust_feature/cow3zod/">kmc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My intuition is that code far away from my code <em>might as well be in another thread</em>,
for all I can reason about what it will do to shared mutable state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s step back a bit and figure out why we need locks in multithreaded programs. The way caches and memory work;
we’ll never need to worry about two processes writing to the same memory location simultaneously and coming up with
a hybrid value, or a read happening halfway through a write.</p>

<p>What we do need to worry about is the rug being pulled out underneath our feet. A bunch of related reads/writes
would have been written with some invariants in mind, and arbitrary reads/writes possibly happening between them
would invalidate those invariants. For example, a bit of code might first read the length of a vector, and then go ahead
and iterate through it with a regular for loop bounded on the length.
The invariant assumed here is the length of the vector. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pop()</code> was called on the vector in some other thread, this invariant could be
invalidated after the read to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">length</code> but before the reads elsewhere, possibly causing a segfault or use-after-free in the last iteration.</p>

<p>However, we can have a situation similar to this (in spirit) in single threaded code. Consider the following:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">some_big_thing</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="py">.some_vec</span><span class="nf">.len</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="n">len</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.do_something_complicated</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="py">.some_vec</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have the same invariant here; but can we be sure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.do_something_complicated()</code> doesn’t modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.some_vec</code> for
some reason? In a complicated codebase, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do_something_complicated()</code> itself calls a lot of other functions which may
also modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>, this can be hard to audit.</p>

<p>Of course, the above example is a simplification and contrived; but it doesn’t seem unreasonable to assume that such
bugs can happen in large codebases — where many methods being called have side effects which may not always be evident.</p>

<p>Which means that in large codebases we have almost the same problem as threaded ones. It’s very hard to maintain invariants
when one is not completely sure of what each line of code is doing. It’s possible to become sure of this by reading through the code
(which takes a while), but further modifications may also have to do the same. It’s impractical to do this all the time and eventually
bugs will start cropping up.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having a static guarantee that this can’t happen is great. And when the code is too convoluted for
a static guarantee (or you just want to avoid the borrow checker), a single-threaded RWlock-esque type called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a>
is available in Rust. It’s a type providing interior mutability and behaves like a runtime version of the borrow checker.
Similar wrappers can be written in other languages.</p>

<p>Edit: In case of many primitives like simple integers, the problems with shared mutability turn out to not be a major issue.
For these, we have a type called <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cell/struct.Cell.html">Cell</a> which lets these be mutated and shared simultaenously. This works on all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>
types; i.e. types which only need to be copied on the stack to be copied. (Unlike types involving pointers or other indirection)</p>

<p>This sort of bug is a good source of reentrancy problems too.</p>

<h2 id="safe-abstractions">Safe abstractions</h2>

<p>In particular, the issue in the previous section makes it hard to write safe abstractions, especially with generic code.
While this problem is clearer in the case of Rust (where abstractions are expected to be safe and preferably low-cost),
this isn’t unique to any language.</p>

<p>Every method you expose has a contract that is expected to be followed. Many times, a contract is handled by type safety itself,
or you may have some error-based model to throw out uncontractual data (for example, division by zero).</p>

<p>But, as an API (can be either internal or exposed) gets more complicated, so does the contract. It’s not always possible to verify that the contract is being violated
at runtime either, for example many cases of iterator invalidation are hard to prevent in nontrivial code even with asserts.</p>

<p>It’s easy to create a method and add documentation “the first two arguments should not point to the same memory”.
But if this method is used by other methods, the contract can change to much more complicated things that are harder to express
or check. When generics get involved, it only gets worse; you sometimes have no way of forcing that there are no shared mutable aliases,
or of expressing what isn’t allowed in the documentation. Nor will it be easy for an API consumer to enforce this.</p>

<p>This makes it harder and harder to write safe, generic abstractions. Such abstractions rely on invariants, and these invariants can often
be broken by the problems in the previous section. It’s not always easy to enforce these invariants, and such abstractions will either
be misused or not written in the first place, opting for a heavier option. Generally one sees that such abstractions or patterns are avoided
altogether, even though they may provide a performance boost, because they are risky and hard to maintain. Even if the present version of
the code is correct, someone may change something in the future breaking the invariants again.</p>

<p><a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/">My previous post</a> outlines a situation where Rust was able to choose
the lighter path in a situation where getting the same guarantees would be hard in C++.</p>

<p>Note that this is a wider problem than just with mutable aliasing. Rust has this problem too, but not when it comes to mutable aliasing.
Mutable aliasing is important to fix however, because we can make a lot of assumptions about our program when there are no mutable aliases.
Namely, by looking at a line of code we can know what happened wrt the locals. If there is the possibility of mutable aliasing out there; there’s the
possibility that other locals were modified too. A very simple example is:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">look_ma_no_temp_var_l33t_interview_swap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">// or</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">look_ma_no_temp_var_rockstar_interview_swap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In both cases, when the two references are the same<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, instead of swapping, the two variables get set to zero.
A user (internal to your library, or an API consumer) would expect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> to not change anything when fed equal
references, but this is doing something totally different. This assumption could get used in a program; for example instead
of skipping the passes in an array sort where the slot is being compared with itself, one might just go ahead with it
because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> won’t change anything there anyway; but it does, and suddenly your sort function fills everything with
zeroes. This could be solved by documenting the precondition and using asserts, but the documentation gets harder and harder
as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> is used in the guts of other methods.</p>

<p>Of course, the example above was contrived. It’s well known that those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> implementations have that precondition,
and shouldn’t be used in such cases. Also, in most swap algorithms it’s trivial to ignore cases when you’re comparing
an element with itself, generally done by bounds checking.</p>

<p>But the example is a simplified sketch of the problem at hand.</p>

<p>In Rust, since this is statically checked, one doesn’t worry much about these problems, and
robust APIs can be designed since knowing when something won’t be mutated can help simplify
invariants.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Aliasing that doesn’t fit the RWLock pattern is dangerous. If you’re using a language like
Rust, you don’t need to worry. If you’re using a language like C++, it can cause memory unsafety,
so be very careful. If you’re using a language like Java or Go, while it can’t cause memory unsafety,
it will cause problems in complex bits of code.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that this problem should force you to switch to Rust, either. If you feel that you
can avoid writing APIs where this happens, that is a valid way to go around it. This problem is much
rarer in languages with a GC, so you might be able to avoid it altogether without much effort. It’s
also okay to use runtime checks and asserts to maintain your invariants; performance isn’t everything.</p>

<p>But this <em>is</em> an issue in programming; and make sure you think of it when designing your code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I was working on a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25027">small feature</a>
for the Rust compiler, and came across a situation which really showcased Rust’s
awesomeness as a language.</p>

<p>There was a struct which was exposed to an API,
and I wished to give it access to a list of things known as “attributes”, where the list was <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html">a heap-allocated vector</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I have two ways of actually giving the struct access to a vector. I can either clone it (i.e. make a copy of its contents), 
or use a reference (pointer) to it or its contents.</p>

<p>In a language like C++ there’s only once choice in this situation; that is
to clone the vector<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. In a large C++ codebase if I wished to use a pointer I would need to be sure that the vector
isn’t deallocated by the time I’m done with it, and more importantly, to be sure that no other code pushes to the vector (when a vector overflows its
capacity it will be reallocated, invalidating any other pointers to its contents).</p>

<p>For a smaller codebase this might be possible, but in this specific case it could have taken me a while to become sure of this.
The code was related to the “expansion” portion of compilation, where the AST is expanded to a bigger AST. A lot of things change and get
moved around, so it is reasonable to assume that it might not be possible to safely use it.
I would have had to find out where the vector is originally stored; all the entry points for the code I was
modifying, and make sure it isn’t being mutated (not as hard in Rust, but I would
still need to muck around a large codebase). And then I would have to somehow make sure that nobody tries to mutate it
in the future. This is a task which I would not even consider trying in C++.</p>

<p>However, I had another option here, because this was Rust. In Rust I can store a reference to the contents of the vector
without fear of invalidation, since the compiler will prevent me from using the vector in a way that could cause unsafety. 
Such a reference is known as a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html">slice</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst in C++ I would have to manually go through a lot of code to be sure of safety
(and even after all that be left with code that would be brittle to changes elsewhere
the codebase), in Rust the compiler can do this for me!</p>

<p>Being able to do this was important
— this code is called quite often for a regular compile, and all those
extra allocations could be heavy, especially given that this was a feature that would be used
by very few.</p>

<p>So first I started off by adding a field to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FieldInfo</code> struct which was a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R285">slice of attributes</a>. Notice that I added a lifetime specifier, <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R273">the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code></a> to the struct definition.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">/// Summary of the relevant parts of a struct/enum field.</span>
<span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">FieldInfo</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">/// ...</span>
    <span class="c">/// The attributes on the field</span>
    <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="n">attrs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Attribute</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For those of you new to Rust, a lifetime is part of the type of a reference. It’s related to the scope of the reference, and generally can be treated as
a generic parameter. So, for example, here, I have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FieldInfo</code> with a lifetime parameter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code> is the lifetime of the inner slice of attributes.
If I construct this struct with slices from different scopes, its type will be different each time. Lifetimes can get automatically cast depending on their context however,
and quite often they get elided away, so one doesn’t need to specify them that much (aside from struct/enum definitions). You can find more information <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ownership.html#lifetimes">in the Rust book</a></p>

<p>I then updated code everywhere to pass the attributes from <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1440">their source</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1155">their destination</a> through the chained methods.</p>

<p>An important thing to note here is that none of the lifetime specifiers you see now in the commit were added when I did this. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1410">the return value
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_struct_pattern</code></a> was
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(P&lt;ast::Pat&gt;, Vec&lt;(Span, Option&lt;Ident&gt;, P&lt;Expr&gt;, &amp;[ast::Attribute])&gt;)</code> at this point, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(P&lt;ast::Pat&gt;, Vec&lt;(Span, Option&lt;Ident&gt;, P&lt;Expr&gt;, &amp;'a [ast::Attribute])&gt;)</code>.
You can ignore the complicated types being passed around, for now just pretend that a slice of attributes was returned.</p>

<p>Now comes the magic. After these small changes necessary for the feature, I basically let the compiler do the rest of the work. See, at this point the code was wrong.
I had forgotten lifetime specifiers in places where they were important, and still wasn’t sure if storing a reference would in fact be possible in the first place.
However, the compiler was smart enough to figure things out for me. It would tell me to add lifetime specifiers, and I would add them.</p>

<p>First, the compiler asked me to add <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R297">a lifetime to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FieldInfo</code> parts of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SubstructureFields</code></a>. So, the following:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">SubstructureFields</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Struct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">FieldInfo</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nf">EnumMatching</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">usize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Variant</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">FieldInfo</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="c">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>became</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">SubstructureFields</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Struct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">FieldInfo</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nf">EnumMatching</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">usize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Variant</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">FieldInfo</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="c">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This needed to happen because elision doesn’t work for structs and enums,
and besides, the compiler would need to know if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;ast::Variant</code> was supposed to be the same lifetime as the parameter of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FieldInfo</code>s. I decided
to just use the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code> parameter, which meant that yes, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;ast::Variant</code> was supposed to live just as long. I could also have opted to give the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FieldInfo</code>s
a different lifetime by adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'b</code> parameter, but I guessed that it would work this way too (knowing the origin of the fieldinfo and variant, and that implicit lifetime casting would
fix most issues that cropped up). I didn’t need to think this out much, though — the compiler gave me a suggestion and I could simply copy it.</p>

<p>The next error was in <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1463"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_enum_variant_pattern()</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R1404"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_struct_pattern()</code></a> as well as some other places.</p>

<p>Here, the method had a signature of</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

<p>and I changed it to</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">create_enum_variant_pattern</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">,</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, the code was uncomfortable with taking a slice of attributes out of an arbitrary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StructDef</code> reference and returning it. What if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StructDef</code> doesn’t live long enough?
Generally the compiler internally figures out the lifetimes necessary and uses them here, but if you have too many references there’s no single way to make the fix.
In this case, the compiler suggested I add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;StructDef</code> and the returned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;[Attribute]</code>, and I did so. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code> lifetime was declared at <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/blob/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b/src/libsyntax/ext/deriving/generic/mod.rs#L379">the top of the impl</a>, so it was the lifetime parameter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. This meant that the returned attribute of the function will
have a lifetime tied to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> and the input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StructDef</code>, and due to this it cannot outlive the inputs, which is what we wanted in the first place. In essence, I took a bit of code that was doing:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">minicreate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">variant</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Variant</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Attribute</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">// do stuff</span>
    <span class="c">// return variant.attributes</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and changed it to</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// we are sure that the returned slice cannot outlive the variant argument</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">minicreate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">variant</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Variant</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nn">ast</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Attribute</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">// do stuff</span>
    <span class="c">// return variant.attributes</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, I didn’t need to think this out much (I’m only thinking it through now for this blog post). I followed the suggestion given to me by the compiler:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>error: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for automatic coercion due to conflicting requirements
help: consider using an explicit lifetime parameter as shown: fn create_enum_variant_pattern&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, cx: &amp;mut ExtCtxt, enum_ident: ast::Ident, variant: &amp;'a ast::Variant, prefix: &amp;str, mutbl: ast::Mutability) -&gt; (P&lt;ast::Pat&gt;, Vec&lt;(Span, Option&lt;Ident&gt;, P&lt;Expr&gt;, &amp;'a [ast::Attribute])&gt;)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There were a couple of similar errors elsewhere that were caused by tying these two lifetimes together. Since these methods were chained, updating the lifetimes of a child method
would mean that I would have to now update the parent method which passes its arguments down to the children and returns a modification of its return value (and thus must now impose the
same restrictions on its own signature). All of this was done by just listening to the suggestions of the compiler (which all contain a function signature to try out). In <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/ede7a6dc8ff5455f9d0d39a90e6d11e9a374e93b#diff-6fa0bf762b2ef85690cce1a0fd8d5a20R890">some cases</a> I introduced a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'b</code> lifetime, because tying it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code>
(the self lifetime parameter) was possibly too restrictive. All of this at the suggestion of the compiler.</p>

<p>While this all seems long and complicated, in reality it wasn’t. I simply added the field to the initial struct, tried compiling a couple of times to figure out which code needed updating
to pass around the attributes, and then went through 3-4 more compilation attempts to fix the lifetimes. It didn’t take long, and I didn’t need to put much mental effort into it. I just
listened to the compiler, and it worked.</p>

<p>And now I trust completely that that code will not cause any segfaults due to attempted access of a destroyed or moved vector. And this is despite the fact that I <em>still</em> don’t know
where that particular vector is modified or destroyed — I didn’t explore that far because I didn’t need to! (or want to :P)</p>

<p>And this is one place Rust really shines. It lets you do optimizations which you wouldn’t dream of doing in C++. In fact, while the C++ way of looking at this problem
would probably be to just clone and move on, most Rust programmers would think of using slices as the default, and not even consider it an “optimization”. And again, this wasn’t
with much cognitive overhead; I could just follow the compiler and it fixed everything for me.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Some people have pointed out that a shared pointer to the vector itself would work here too. This is correct, but a shared pointer also has a runtime overhead, and more importantly doesn’t prevent iterator invalidation. I had no idea how the vector was being used elsewhere, so this was a risk I didn’t want to take. Additionally, whilst a shared pointer to the vector itself is immune to the issue of the vector being moved, since this was an API, someone consuming the API might take a reference of an attribute and hold on to it long enough for it to become invalidated. This is something we can’t have either – an API consumer should not have to worry about where the pointers will invalidate. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Note: This is not the lifetime of the reference <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;self</code>, which is the lifetime of the pointer (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'b self</code>), but the lifetime parameter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TraitDef&lt;'a&gt;</code>, which has a lifetime parameter for its child fields. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
