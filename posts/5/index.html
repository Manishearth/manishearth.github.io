  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got a job!</p>

<p>I’m now working at Mozilla as a Research Engineer, on <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>.</p>

<p>I started two weeks ago, and so far I’m really enjoying it! I feel quite lucky to
get to work on an open source project; with an amazing and helpful team. Getting to do most
of my work in Rust is great, too :)</p>

<p>So far I’ve been working on the network stack (specifically, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11556">“making fetch happen”</a>),
and I’ll probably be spending time on DOM things as well.</p>

<p>Really excited to see how this goes!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Follow up article to this one <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/08/10/interactive-sudoku-zero-knowledge-proof/">here</a></em></p>

<p>So recently I read <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/">this article</a> about how the Bitcoin community had executed
what’s known as a “Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment”; a pretty neat concept.</p>

<p>What was really interesting for me was the <a href="https://people.xiph.org/~greg/simple_verifyable_execution.txt">(simplified) underlying algorithm</a> for generic
zero knowledge proofs. It took me a while (and some questions asked to helpful folks on the
Internet) to understand it fully, but the concept is quite intriguing and sounds rather magical. I
thought I’d explain it here in an accessible way, both so that others can get it and to
improve my own understanding.</p>

<p>I intend this article to be read by people with a programming or mathematical background<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>,
who have some understanding of what logic gates are. Please let me know if you feel that something
is inadequately (or wrongly) explained.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof">So what is a zero knowledge proof?</h2>

<p>Let’s say Alice has a problem she wants to solve. It could be a mathematical problem, like
factorizing a large number, or coloring a map (or graph!) with only three colors, or solving a
Sudoku puzzle. Anything where you can write a program to verify the solution.</p>

<p>She doesn’t have the resources to solve the problem herself, but wants to buy a solution from
someone else. She makes the problem public, and Bob says he has a solution.</p>

<p>However, Alice is skeptical. She’s not sure if Bob is telling the truth here, and would like some
evidence that he does indeed have a solution. At the same time, Bob is not willing to share his
solution with Alice without getting paid. They also don’t want to involve a third party; let’s say
this is a rather Important Sudoku Puzzle that affects National Security ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>What Alice and Bob need here is a way for Bob to prove to Alice that he has the solution, without
sharing the solution, and without involving a third party<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is totally possible (magical, right!). There’s a quick example
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Abstract_example">on Wikipedia</a> of a simple proof of a non-mathematical fact – whether or not someone
has a key to a particular door.</p>

<p>For proving more complicated problems, we have to digress into some basic crypto first</p>

<h2 id="interlude-hashes-and-commitments">Interlude: Hashes and commitments</h2>

<p><em>Feel free to skip this if you know what a hash function and a nonce is.</em></p>

<p>In cryptography, there’s something called a “hash function”. In essence it’s an “irreversible”
function whose output is known as a “hash”, with the following three properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s not computationally intensive to calculate the hash of an input</li>
  <li>Given a hash, it’s a computationally hard problem to calculate an input to the hash function that results in this hash, usually involving brute force</li>
  <li>It’s also a computationally hard problem, given an input and a hash, to find a different input (<em>especially</em> a different input that is similar to the first one) that produces the same hash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that multiple values <em>may</em> result in the same hash.</p>

<p>The result of this is basically that hashes are hard to forge. If Bob shares a hash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y = H(X)</code> with
Alice, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is some secret data and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code> is a hash function, if Bob reveals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> at some later
point, by checking that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y = H(X)</code>, Alice can be reasonably certain that the value shared by Bob was
indeed the original input to the hash function and not tampered with in a way that the same hash was
produced. Similarly, Bob can be certain that knowing only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, Alice cannot reverse-engineer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>
since the hash function is “irreversible”.</p>

<p>This brings us to the concept of a commitment. Hashes can be used as described above to “commit” to
a value. If Bob decides on a number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, and makes its hash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code> public, he has committed to this
value without revealing it. When he does decide to reveal it, he is forced to reveal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> and not
some modified bogus value, thus making the “commitment” binding.</p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed a flaw here: It’s hard to commit to small numbers, or things that come
from a restricted set. If Bob wishes to commit to the number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> (without revealing it), or the
color <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red</code> (out of a set of three colors), Alice can just try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H(0)</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H(9)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H(red),
H(green), H(blue)</code> and find out which one matches. After all, hashes aren’t supposed to be resilient
to brute force attacks, and brute force attacks become very easy when the set of inputs is tiny.</p>

<p>A solution to this is to use a <em>nonce</em> (also known as a “trapdoor”). Bob commits to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> by hashing
the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code> is a random value he selected, known as
a “nonce”. When Bob wishes to reveal the value, he just reveals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code> and Alice is
convinced that the original value committed to was indeed 5. Of course, this requires some agreement
on the format of the nonce; in this case the nonce is just “everything after the dash”. Note that
the nonce is private, and only revealed when Bob wishes to reveal the committed number.</p>

<p>Note that each new commitment should use a new nonce. Otherwise, information can be leaked; for
example if Bob needs to commit to three numbers (say, 2, 5, 2) in a way that they can be
individually revealed, he shouldn’t compute the hashes for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry, 5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry, 2-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code>, since the first
and last hashes will be equal and Alice will know that the committed values behind them are probably
the same too (something which you may not wish to reveal).</p>

<p>Another issue that can turn up is a “rainbow table”, where one party comes into the game with a
precomputed table of hashes of all strings up till a certain number of characters. One solution for
this is to increase the nonce size, however since Bob decides the nonces it’s possible for him to
smartly select them if he’s the one with a table. The solution here is to use a “salt”, which is a
large random string combined with the committed value and hash. Bob and Alice could, for example,
mutually decide on a salt of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asdcjyxeafxjvikfzmnyfqsehsxwxsfywbreb</code>, and when Bob wishes to
commit to the number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code>, he hashes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asdcjyxeafxjvikfzmnyfqsehsxwxsfywbreb-5-vektvzkjyfdqtnwry</code>. Note that salts work similar
to nonces here, however the salt is known publically (you can model it as a last-minute modification
of the agreed-upon hash function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code>, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H'(X) = H(add_salt(X))</code>). In some cases, you may also
want a per-instance salt, which is mutually decided every time Bob wants to compute a hash.</p>

<p>Hashes are a useful building block for many things; they’re a key component in password security, as
well as being part of all kinds of cryptographics protocols. In this post we’ll mainly focus on
their ability to be used as a unbreakable commitment.</p>

<p>Back to your regularly scheduled blog post.</p>

<h2 id="coloring-graphs">Coloring graphs</h2>

<p>The classic example of zero knowledge proofs is graph coloring.  I’ll run through a quick
explanation, though it’s explained beautifully <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer.html">here</a> too.</p>

<p>Let’s say Alice has a graph:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/alice-graph.png" /></p>

<p>No, not that kind, Alice. The <em>other</em> graph.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-uncolored.dot.png" /></p>

<p>She wants it colored such that no two adjacent nodes share a color. This is an NP-complete problem (so
it can take up a lot of computational resources to solve). Of course, <em>this</em> graph is small and easy
to color, but that’s just for the sake of this blog post.</p>

<p>Bob, using his trusty Crayola™ 3-crayon set<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, has managed to come up with a valid coloring:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-colored.dot.png" /></p>

<p>He wishes to prove that he has this to Alice, without revealing it or involving a third party.
Probably for National Security Reasons. Something something Nicolas Cage.</p>

<p>Bob and Alice meet, and Alice gives him a large piece of paper with the (uncolored) graph drawn on
it.</p>

<p>Bob goes into a private room, and colors it. He also covers each graph node with a hat. Alice now
enters the room.</p>

<p>Alice chooses an adjacent pair of nodes. Let’s say she chooses 1 and 2. Bob removes those two hats
(since Alice is watching him, he has no chance to tamper with the colorings underneath the hats
before revealing them). Now, Alice knows the colors of nodes 1 and 2:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-12.dot.png" /></p>

<p>This lets her verify that nodes 1 and 2 had different colorings in the graph Bob drew.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t actually <em>tell</em> her anything about Bob’s coloring aside from the increased
probability of correctness. The colors can always be permuted, so <em>any</em> valid coloring would give
the same answer here if the colors were permuted so that 1 is red and 2 is blue. This is important;
we don’t want to leak information about Bob’s solution aside from the fact that it is correct.</p>

<p>Nor is this information enough to verify correctness. Bob could have equally drawn a wrong
coloring.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotgen/graph-wrong.dot.png" /></p>

<p>(clearly someone wasn’t paying attention in kindergarten)</p>

<p>Since Alice only looked at nodes 1 and 2, she didn’t see anything wrong with the graph. But if she
had by chance picked nodes 3 and 4, Bob’s deception would have been revealed.</p>

<p>So she only has 14% (1/7) certainity<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that Bob’s graph is correct.</p>

<p>However, we can run this experiment again. Bob can permute the colors, draw on a fresh copy of the
graph, and ask Alice to choose another pair of adjacent nodes. She can check this, and the
probability of correctness will increase to around 27% (1 - (6/7)*(6/7)).</p>

<p>Since Bob has permuted the colors, Alice cannot use the information from the previous round to glean
any information about Bob’s solution in this round. Of course, Bob is free to produce a completely
different coloring (one that is not a permutation), with a different flaw this time. Regardless of
where the flaw is, Alice still has a chance of uncovering it each time.</p>

<p>This can continue until Alice is satisfied that there is a very little chance that Bob has cheated.
For example, after 60 rounds, Alice would be 99.99% certain.</p>

<p>Note that this didn’t actually involve any cryptography; it was an algorithm based on <em>information
flow</em>. However, if you want this to work securely (in the current solution Alice could push Bob away
and reveal all the nodes herself) and make it work without requiring Alice and Bob to be in the same
location, you need to use hashes.</p>

<p>Remember when Bob colored the graph whilst alone in the secret room? Once Alice had entered the
room, this coloring was <em>committed</em>. There was no way for Bob to tamper with this coloring.</p>

<p>We do the same thing here. After obtaining a valid coloring, Bob <em>commits</em> to this coloring by
calculating some hashes.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Node</th><th>Color(private)</th><th>Nonce(private)</th><th>Hash</th></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td>red</td><td>wmdqatobck</td><td>e1f957bedcceeb217305bfa12cbee4abac36eff1</td></tr>

</table>
<p><br /></p>

<p>(The hashes here are calculated using SHA-1 for the hashing algorithm. It’s not considered very
secure anymore, but the secure ones all output huge hashes which spill over the page)</p>

<p>Bob sends the public part of the table (the node-hash mapping) to Alice. Alice asks for nodes 1 and
2, and Bob reveals the entire table entry for those two nodes (including the nonce).</p>

<p>Note that since Alice now knows the color and nonce for nodes 1 and 2, she can verify that the
colors shown are indeed the ones Bob committed to. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo red-wmdqatobck | sha1sum</code> if you want to
check on a local Unixy shell.</p>

<p>As in the previous case, Alice can repeat this algorithm until she reaches an acceptable level of
certainty (each time with a permutation of colors and a new set of nonces).</p>

<p>A lot of zero knowledge proofs (but not all!) are inherently probabalistic and interactive. They
involve multiple rounds where in each round the prover (Bob) commits to something, the verifier
(Alice) challenges the prover to reveal some information. The process repeats, with the certainity
on the verifier’s side approaching 100% as more and more rounds happen.</p>

<h2 id="zero-knowledge-proof-for-general-execution">Zero Knowledge Proof for General Execution</h2>

<p>It turns out that you can have a ZKP exchange for the execution of any algorithm that can be
transcribed into combinatorical logic. In other words, you should be able to write the program
without loops and recursion, though loops bounded by a constant are allowed<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This isn’t as
restrictive as it seems, usually <em>verification</em> is a straightforward task not involving convoluted
loops. The examples above (graph coloring<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, sudoku, prime factorization<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>) can all be verified
without loops.</p>

<p>The algorithm shown here is by Gregory Maxwell, originally published <a href="https://people.xiph.org/~greg/simple_verifyable_execution.txt">here</a>. It’s somewhat
inefficient, but it demonstrates the idea behind ZKP for general execution. As mentioned there, it
can be optimized using techniques described in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/155.pdf">this paper</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s get started. Any combinatorical program can be decomposed into a bunch of AND and NOT
gates, taking in a bunch of input values and giving out one or more output values. For simplicity
let’s assume that the problem statement (i.e. the specific sudoku puzzle, etc) that needs verifying
is embedded inside the program, and the final output of the program is just a single boolean
indicating whether or not the input is a solution. This algorithm, however, can work for programs
with arbitrarily large outputs.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob do this decomposition. The also agree on a numbering of the AND gates. Let’s say
that there are N AND gates. We’re mostly going to ignore the NOT gates for the purpose of this
article – they’re there, but they aren’t modified or anything.</p>

<h3 id="creating-encrypted-and-gates">Creating encrypted AND gates</h3>

<p>Now, Bob creates 4*N <em>encrypted AND gates</em>. This is an AND gate, but with the
inputs and outputs all muddled up.</p>

<p>This is a regular AND gate:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-and.png" width="200" /></p>

<p>This is an encrypted AND gate:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-and.png" width="200" /></p>

<p>(yes, it can be identical to an AND gate)</p>

<p>So is this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr1.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>and this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr2.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Basically, each input and the output may or may not be inverted. We can model this in a different
way, there is an <em>encryption key</em> corresponding to each input and output. This key is XORd with the
input/output (so if the key is 1, the wire is inverted, and if the key is 0, the wire is not
inverted).</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr-xor.png" width="500" /></p>

<p>A regular AND gate has a truth table as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Input 1</th>
      <th>Input 2</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This truth table, encrypted (with the input keys \(e_1 = 1, e_2 = 0\) and output key \(e_o = 1\))
is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Encrypted Input 1</th>
      <th>Encrypted Input 2</th>
      <th>Encrypted Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
So, if the encrypted gate gets the (encrypted) inputs 1 and 0, its (encrypted) output will be 1.</p>

<p>Since XOR is its own inverse (\(x \oplus y \oplus y\) is just \(x\)), if we wish to encrypt
an input before piping it through this gate, we just XOR it with the relevant input key. If we wish
to decrypt the output, we again XOR it with the output key. The XOR gates being applied will just
cancel out with the internal encryption gates. In other words, encryption and decryption are done
with the same operation!</p>

<p>To recap, the dotted box below is an encrypted AND gate. An encrypted input enters from the left,
and is decrypted by the internal XOR gate to obtain the actual input, which is piped through the AND
gate. To encrypt an input so that it can be passed into this gate, one uses the same key with an XOR
(not shown in the diagram). Similarly, the actual output of the AND gate exits on the right, and is
encrypted by the XOR gate at the output to get the “encrypted output” (the wire that extends out of
the box). To decrypt this, one must apply the same XOR operation to the encrypted output to recover
the actual output of the gate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr-xor.png" width="500" /></p>

<h3 id="creating-adaptation-keys-and-commitments">Creating adaptation keys and commitments</h3>

<p>Now, unlike regular AND gates, these encrypted AND gates cannot be composed. The output of an
encrypted AND gate is encrypted, with a potentially different encryption key as to that of the next
gate’s input. So, we insert an “adaptation key” between the two. For example, if the output of the
first gate is connected to the first input of the second gate, we need to insert this operation
between the two gates:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/and-encr-adapt.png" width="500" /></p>

<p>We XOR by \(e_o\) of the first gate (to decrypt), and then again XOR by \(e_1\) of the second gate (to
reencrypt). This operation is the same as XORing by \(e_o \oplus e_1\), which is the
“adaptation key”. Every pair of encrypted gates will have an adaptation key for every configuration
they can be placed in.</p>

<p>Alright. Bob creates a ton of these “encrypted gates”, and calculates all the adaptation keys for every possible pair of gates. He also mixes up the truth tables of each encrypted gate<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Now, he commits to these truth tables. A commitment for each entry in each truth table is made, so
he’ll end up with something like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Encrypted Input 1</th>
      <th>Encrypted Input 2</th>
      <th>Encrypted Output</th>
      <th>nonce</th>
      <th>commitment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>..</td>
      <td>H(001 + nonce)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>..</td>
      <td>H(101 + nonce)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>..</td>
      <td>H(010 + nonce)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>..</td>
      <td>H(111 + nonce)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
He also commits to each of the adaptation keys and each of the encryption keys.</p>

<p>As usual, all the commitments will be sent to Alice. Alice will then have data like: “Commitment for
Gate 1 entry 1: .., Commitment for Gate 2 entry 2:.., … Commitment for Gate 2 entry 1: .., ….
Commitment for adaptation key between Gate 1’s output and Gate 2’s first input: .., Commitment for
adaptation key between Gate 1’s output and Gate 2’s second input: .., Commitment for encryption key
for Gate 1’s first input, …”.</p>

<h3 id="shuffling-and-revealing">Shuffling and revealing</h3>

<p>These commitments are taken in some predefined order, and the resultant monster string is hashed
(without a nonce). This “superhash” is used as the seed to a pseudorandom number generator which is
used to shuffle the gates. Both Alice and Bob can calculate this shuffling.</p>

<p>This post-shuffle ordering is used after this point. The hash-shuffle is important here because it
adds a layer of tamper protection. If Bob wishes to tamper with the, say 4th gate post-shuffle, Bob
would have to create a bad gate before making the commitments; this changes the commitments, and
thus the shuffle order, and so the tampered gate will not end up being the 4th gate. Basically, it’s
hard to control where the tampered gate will end up.</p>

<p>Now, out of the 4N  gates, Bob takes the last 2N, and reveals everything about them: Their
encryption keys, the nonces for their truth table commitments, and all adaptation keys between
these gates (along with the nonces for the adaptation key commitments).</p>

<p>Alice ensures that everything in this revealed data adds up. All the truth tables, after decryption,
should actually be AND gate truth tables. All adaptation keys must match up with their relevant
encryption keys. All commitments must match up.</p>

<h3 id="double-trouble">Double trouble!</h3>

<p>Bob duplicates the AND-and-NOT-gate based circuit. He now has two identical circuits which take
the same inputs, and have one output each. In itself this is pretty useless; this circuit is
obviously redundant. However, in the context of encrypted gates, this redundancy becomes useful.</p>

<p>Bob drops in the 2*N encrypted gates into this double-circuit, using the post-shuffle ordering of
encrypted gates and the predecided numbering<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> of the AND gates in the circuit. He puts the
necessary adaptation gates (i.e. an XOR operation with the relevant adaptation key) between
encrypted AND gates to make the circuit work. Note that each “half” of the circuit has a different
set of encrypted gates, and thus a different encryption key for each input. There are NOT gates here
too (from the original circuit, which was made of ANDs and NOTs); they stay in place (the adaptation
gate can go on either side of them) with no modifications or encryption.</p>

<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>

<p>Let’s recall that Bob is claiming to have the correct input for the original circuit – the input
that makes that circuit output true.</p>

<p>Since Bob has all the encryption keys, he can encrypt this correct input to get the correct
encrypted input, which should make the new circuit output true (well, encrypted true) as well.</p>

<p>Bob goes ahead and does this. He encrypts the input (since there are different encryption keys for
either side of the circuit, he does this twice), and runs it through the circuit. He notes down the
truth table entry utilized for each gate. He ensures that the output, once decrypted, is true (it
should be, if everything has been done correctly till now).</p>

<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>

<p>He now reveals the details of the program execution to Alice. He reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All adaptation gates involved (and their nonces, to verify the commitments)</li>
  <li>All truth table <em>entries</em> involved in the execution (and their nonces …).</li>
  <li>The output encryption key (and its nonce)</li>
  <li>The encrypted inputs</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice goes ahead and verifies that the commitments have not been reneged upon. Note that she also
now has a full execution history. It’s an <em>encrypted</em> history – she can’t calculate the original
input from it – but she can verify that the execution was faithfully carried out. While she doesn’t
have the entire truth table for any encrypted gate, she has the entry that was used in the
execution, which is enough. She just has to ensure that the inputs to a gate match the truth table
entry, use the entry to see what the output is, apply the relevant adaptation key to get the input
for the next gate, and repeat.</p>

<p>And there you have it. Alice has verified that Bob faithfully executed her verification circuit, and
thus he must have the correct answer to her problem.</p>

<h3 id="tampering">Tampering?</h3>

<p>Let’s see if it’s possible for Bob to tamper with any of this. If Bob wishes to tamper with one of
the gates, he has to tamper with the gates before calculating commitments, which means that the
shuffling will get mixed up, which will mean that he can’t control where the tampered gate will end
up in the final circuit. This is compounded by the fact that half the gates are revealed (so the
tampered gate may end up in the wrong set), and that there are <em>two</em> copies of the circuit (so you
need to tamper with both sides simultaneously, requiring even more luck on getting the shuffle where
you want it).</p>

<p>The probability of Bob being able to execute a succesful tamper can be adjusted by increasing the
number of revealed gates, and increasing the duplication of the circuit. There is also the
aforementioned fudge factor that can be introduced by having Alice choose where each encrypted gate
should go after Bob has already provided commitments, and finally the procedure can be repeated as
many times as necessary with a fresh set of encrypted gates to increase certainty. Unlike the graph
coloring algorithm (where the uncertainty in a single run was large – if Bob has a couple of wrong
edges there’s relatively small chance he’ll get caught); here in a single run it is Bob who has a
massive disadvantage, since he must tamper with <em>exactly</em> the right gates, and there’s very little
chance that his tampered gates will fall in the right place based on Alice’s chosen ordering.
Additionally, tampering with the gates in the first place is hard, since you need to avoid having
them get revealed. I think that with reasonable (e.g., not asking for something like 1000 duplicated
circuits) choices on the level of duplication and number of revealed gates, it’s possible for Alice
to get a very high level of certainty without needing to conduct multiple rounds.</p>

<p>How about the opposite question: Can Alice find out anything about the input, aside from the fact
that it is correct, from the information she has? At first glance it seems like she can, because she
can see the whole path of execution. In case of a program with non-constant loops, this would be
damning, since she can figure out how many executions happened (and thus know the decrypted value
for the number of loop iterations) and backtrack using that in a cleverly-written program. However,
this program has no loops.</p>

<p>Looking at it closely, any encrypted history of execution can be changed to a different encrypted
history of execution for the same nonencrypted execution by adding NOT gates wherever they don’t
match, and then absorbing these NOT gates into the input or output keys (by NOTing them) of the
adjacent encrypted AND gates. This means that without knowing the details of the encrypted gates,
all histories of execution are equally possible for a given actual execution<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>. Therefore,
knowing only a history of execution does not provide you further information about the actual
execution, since it could equally have been for some other history of execution.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-fixing-the-escrow-and-bitcoin">Bonus: Fixing the escrow and Bitcoin</h2>

<p>(I’m going to assume basic knowledge of Bitcoin later on in this section)</p>

<p>After all this, we still only have a way of Bob <em>proving</em> he has a solution. There’s no way of
securely exchanging the solution for money (or whatever) without involving a trusted third party to
handle the swap. This is known as <em>escrow</em>, where a third party is given both items for swapping;
and after checking that everything is in order the third party completes the swap.</p>

<p>We can build on this so that the third party is only trusted with the money, and cannot actually
peek at the answer.</p>

<p>It’s pretty straightforward: Bob and Alice mutually agree on a shared secret “pad” P. Bob takes his
answer, bitwise-XORs it with the pad (which is of the same length as the answer) to get padded input
X, and then hashes it to get hash Y.</p>

<p>Now, initially we had a verification program which proves the statement “This input is a solution to
Alice’s problem”. We modify this program so that it proves the following two statements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This input is a solution to Alice’s problem</li>
  <li>When the input is XORd with P, and subsequently hashed, the hash that comes out is Y</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice and Bob now go through the ZKP algorithm and the above is proven. Of course, they must keep
the exchange between themselves, since the value of the pad (which can be extracted from the
circuit) must remain secret.</p>

<p>Assuming that Bob isn’t able to cause any hash collisions, Alice at this point would be happy with a
number that, when hashed, gives Y. This is something that escrow can verify, since neither Y nor X
can be reverse-engineered to get the original answer unless you have P.</p>

<p>Now, Alice puts the money in escrow, and notifies the third party handing escrow of the value of Y
(the hash). Bob puts the padded input X in escrow as well. The third party verifies that Y is the
hash of X, and releases the money to Bob and the padded input to Alice. Since Alice knows pad P, she
can XOR it with X to recover the original real input. Everyone walks away happy!</p>

<p>Well, maybe not. There still is the danger of the third party handling escrow to walk away with the
money. Why trust any one party?</p>

<p>Turns out that Bitcoin proves to be an alternative to this situation. The technique described in
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/">Greg Maxwell’s article</a> (called Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment), builds upon
the above protocol using “scripts” in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The way a Bitcoin transaction works is that anyone (well, the first person) who can solve the
embedded challenge is allowed to use the money contained in it. Like a piñata. Except with money
instead of candy and public-key cryptography instead of a stick.</p>

<p><em>Most</em> Bitcoin transactions pay directly to a person, and they use a standard kind of challenge (the
actual script is <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Standard_Transaction_to_Bitcoin_address_.28pay-to-pubkey-hash.29">here</a>). If Alice wishes to pay Bob 5 BTC, Alice crafts a
transaction which says “anyone with the private key behind Bob’s public key (his address) may spend
this money”. Of course, in practice this means that only Bob can spend the money. Alice created a
piñata which only Bob can break.</p>

<p>We can build on this to make the Bitcoin network behave as a trustworthy escrow. After having
stepped through the zero-knowledge protocol and being confident that Y is the hash of the padded
input, Alice crafts a transaction which says “anyone with a string that results in this hash may
spend this money”<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>. Bob has this string; it is the padded answer X. He makes a transaction with
X as part of the input script (so that he can claim the money); and the Bitcoin network accepts it.
Assuming Alice and Bob are not able to tamper with each others’ local networks, by the time Alice
sees the transaction containing X, the network should have accepted this transaction already (though
it may not yet be part of the blockchain), and Bob should be getting his money.</p>

<p>(In case the crucial part is trusting that the escrow doesn’t run off with the money, and you don’t
care if other people can see the answer, you can skip the padding step and directly hash the input.
I believe the proof of concept executed in Greg’s post did this, but I’m not sure)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One reason I really like open source is that it offers a lot of great opportunities for newish programmers to get some hands-on experience with real world problems. There’s only so much one can learn from small personal projects; but in open source one often gets to tackle interesting problems on large codebases — problems which wouldn’t occur in small/personal ones. There are also valuable skills related to collaboration to be learnt.</p>

<p>Because of this, I care quite a bit about making projects welcoming to new contributions, and try to improve this experience on projects I’m involved in. I’ve picked up a few tricks along the way. Most of these aren’t my ideas, I’ve gleaned them from watching people like <a href="https://twitter.com/lastontheboat">Josh Matthews</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mleibovic">Margaret Leibovic</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_conley">Mike Conley</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/redheadedcuban">Joel Maher</a> do their thing. If you’re interested, <a href="http://blog.margaretleibovic.com/2013/08/06/increasing-volunteer-participation-on-the-firefox.html">here</a> is a post by Margaret, and <a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/fsoss15/contribution.html">here</a> are some of Josh’s slides from a presentation, both on the same subject.</p>

<p>Before I get started, bear in mind that making a project “newbie-friendly” isn’t something that magically happens. Like most things, it takes effort, but often this effort can come to fruition in the form of motivated contributors helping out on your project and eventually even becoming co-maintainers. It’s really worth it!</p>

<h2 id="the-simple-stuff">The simple stuff</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of really easy stuff you can do to kickstart contributions to your own project. Most of this is obvious:</p>

<h3 id="contributingmd">CONTRIBUTING.md</h3>

<p><strong>Add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTING.md</code></strong> file. Keep it up to date. Link to it prominently from the README. The README should also have clear and detailed instructions for building the project. These two files are different – README is for those who want to use your project (perhaps by building from sources), CONTRIBUTING is for people who want to contribute.</p>

<p><strong>Mention steps for getting involved</strong>: how to find something to work on, how to send a patch/make a pull request, a checklist of things to ensure your patch/PR satisfies before submission (e.g. passing tests, commit message guidelines, etc).
Additionally, include some tips and tricks (like a link to the internal documentation) that can help new contributors, links to communication channels (IRC, Slack, Gitter, whatever) and anything else you may find helpful for someone considering contributing to your project. If you use some form of issue labeling, explanations of the labeling scheme can help folks find stuff they want to work on. An overview of the directory structure can be similarly helpful.</p>

<p>For some examples, check out the CONTRIBUTING.md files for <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">rust-clippy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="maintain-a-list-of-easy-bugs">Maintain a list of easy bugs</h3>

<p>More on this later, but try to <strong>use some form of tagging to mark easy bugs</strong>. I love <a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/fsoss15/contribution.html?full#issuetracker">this slide</a> from Josh’s talk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to politely say f*** off</p>

  <p>“Choose something to work on from our issue tracker.” <br />
                                           - every project maintainer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most bugs on issue trackers are nontrivial, steeped with jargon, devoid of actionable information, or otherwise inaccessible to the average new contributor. It’s relatively low effort to recognize bugs which are “easy” for maintainers, but it’s a lot of work for people unfamiliar to this project to figure this out.</p>

<p>A simple label on GitHub is all you need in most cases. Be sure to link to it from your contributing file!</p>

<h3 id="communicate">Communicate!</h3>

<p><strong>Have open channels</strong> for communication. IRC is often the favorite here, though IRC is pretty alien for people getting involved in open source for the first time. If you’re using IRC, see if you can link to a web client (like <a href="https://wiki.mibbit.com/index.php/Widget">Mibbit</a>) with short instructions on how to join. Stuff like Gitter works too.</p>

<p>Mailing lists also work — everyone knows how to email! However, email can be intimidating to newcomers; many have a “omg I can’t ask my silly questions here!” attitude which stops them from progressing.</p>

<p>Explicitly inviting questions in each issue helps here. Clippy doesn’t have a mailing list or IRC channel (too small a project), but I encourage people working on new bugs to ping me on any communication channel they’d like. I’ve mentored people over email, GH issue threads, IRC, even reddit PMs, and it’s worked out fine in each case.</p>

<p>Often folks will PM you for help. Provide help, but <strong>encourage them to ask questions</strong> in the main venue. This has the twofold benefit of showing everyone that the main channel is open to questions, and it also helps people get quicker answers since someone else can answer if you’re not around.</p>

<h3 id="recognition">Recognition</h3>

<p><strong>Celebrate new contributors</strong>. Tweet about them. Mention them in blog posts. Getting a two-line patch accepted in an open source project doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re just getting started, it’s a very awesome feeling. Make it more awesome! Both <a href="http://this-week-in-rust.org/">This Week In Rust</a> and <a href="https://blog.servo.org/">This Week In Servo</a> mention new contributors (sometimes we tweet about it too), and I’ve often got very happy messages from these contributors about the mentions.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-code-of-conduct">Add a code of conduct</h3>

<p>A lot of folks have had bad experiences with people online, often in other open source communities and may be wary about joining others. <strong>A code of conduct</strong> is a statement that unsavory behavior won’t be tolerated, which helps make the project more welcoming and appealing to these people, simultaneously making it a nicer place which is helpful for everyone. Of course, you should be prepared to enforce the code of conduct if the situation requires it.</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html">Rust code of conduct</a> but the <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> is good, too. Various language/framework communities often have their own favorite code of conduct. Pick one.</p>

<h3 id="empathize">Empathize!</h3>

<p>We often forget how hard it is to jumpstart in something we’re an active part of. For example, for many of us the process of making a pull request is almost second nature.</p>

<p>However, not everyone is used to these things. I’ve seen contributors who can code well but haven’t used Github in the past having lots of trouble making and updating a pull request. The same applies to other workflow things; like code review, version control<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, or build system peculiarities.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind when dealing with new contributors. These are skills which can be picked up relatively quickly, but those without them will have a frustrating experience and end up asking you a lot of questions.</p>

<h2 id="improving-the-newcomer-experience">Improving the newcomer experience</h2>

<p>Alright, now you’ve gotten all the basics done. People now have a vague idea of how to contribute to your project. Let’s make it more concrete.</p>

<h3 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h3>

<p>Don’t just leave an easy bug open. <strong>Offer to mentor it!</strong> This is a very fun and rewarding experience, and of course contributors are more likely to stick around in a project they percieve to be helpful and welcoming.</p>

<p>It’s often better to go one step further and <strong>give tips for fixing the issue before anyone even picks it up</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10969#issuecomment-158282317">example</a>). Communication in open source has latency — the contributor might be on the other side of the planet, or might otherwise be contributing at a different time of the day than you<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Reducing the number of back-and-forth cycles is really helpful here, and giving some info so that a contributor can get started immediately without needing to wait for a response goes a long way in improving the newcomer experience.</p>

<p>Avoid creating a mentored bug where you yourself aren’t certain on how to fix it. Ideally, <strong>you should know the exact steps to take to fix a bug</strong> before marking it as mentored. Don’t divulge all the steps to the mentee, but the exercise of solving the bug yourself (without writing the code) ensures that there aren’t any hidden traps.</p>

<p>Mostly mentorship just involves <strong>answering questions and laying out a path</strong> for the mentee. Be sure to encourage questions in the first place! A lot of people, especially students, are intimidated when joining open source and try to stay as quiet as possible. For a healthy mentorship, you want them to ask questions. A lot. Encourage this.</p>

<p>Remember that in many cases the new contributor may be intimidated by <em>you</em>. For example, I’ve often come across new Firefox contributors (who I introduced to the project) asking me questions instead of their assigned mentor because “the mentor works for Mozilla and is way too awesome for me to bug with questions”. This wasn’t something the mentor told them (Firefox mentors are all very nice and helpful people), it was a conclusion they came to on their own — one which would impede their progress on the bug.</p>

<p>One trick that helps mitigate this is encouraging questions in your main channel. When people PM me with questions on IRC, I answer their questions, but also encourage them to ask in the main IRC channel next time. This is good for everyone — It gives the channel an aura of being “okay to ask questions in” (if other people see that questions are being asked and answered in the channel), and it also lets other maintainers jump in to help the new contributor in case I’m not around.</p>

<p>Once a new contributor has fixed a bug, mentorship isn’t over – it’s just started! See if you can find something more involved for them to work in a related area of the codebase. Get to know the contributor too, a sense of familiarity goes a long way in reducing intimidation and other friction.</p>

<h3 id="tailoring-process-for-newcomers">Tailoring process for newcomers</h3>

<p>Most open source projects have a set of hoops you have to jump through for a pull request to be accepted. These are necessary for the health of the project and pretty straightforward for existing contributors, but can be intimidating for new ones. They also add extra cycles of communication. I’ve often seen people put up almost-working patches, and disappear after a few cycles — even though the bulk of the work was done and there were just process issues (or code nits) left over for merging; which can be quite disheartening. Reducing extra process helps mitigate this.</p>

<p>For example, Servo uses this great tool called <a href="http://reviewable.io/">Reviewable</a> for code review. Regular contributors don’t have much friction whilst using this, so we use it wherever possible. However, for small pull requests from new contributors I avoid using Reviewable and instead opt to review directly from the GitHub interface. For these pull requests I don’t need Reviewable’s features, so I don’t lose much, but now the contributor has to go through one less hoop.</p>

<p>Similarly, for rust-clippy, I often make minor fixes and run <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/blob/master/util/update_lints.py">the readme update script</a> on behalf of the contributor instead of asking them to do it themselves. I usually check out the PR locally, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git merge pr-branch --no-commit --no-ff</code><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, make edits, commit and push. This way the PR still gets marked as merged (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit --amend</code> doesn’t do that), and the history stays bisectable.</p>

<p>OpenSSL uses a mailing list for patches, however they allow contributions via GitHub too. Most seasoned contributors probably stick to the mailing list, but new contributors can use the familiar GitHub interface if they want, reducing friction.</p>

<p>Of course, cutting down on (necessary) process should only be done for the first one or two contributions; try to educate the newcomer about your processes as time passes.</p>

<p>An alternate way to tackle this issue is to go the other way around and teach process first. Give newcomers an extremely easy bug that just involves replacing a string or some other simple one-line fix, and help them push it through the process. This way, the next time they work on something, they’ll be familiar with the process and be able to devote more time to the actual code.</p>

<h3 id="creating-easy-bugs">Creating easy bugs</h3>

<p>At some point down this road many projects have a problem where there are people who want to contribute, but not enough suitable easy bugs.</p>

<p>One technique that has helped me create a lot of easy bugs is to just <strong>look out for separable and non-critical subfeatures when working on something</strong>. There often are things like polish or other small features which you don’t need to include in the main pull request, but you do anyway because it’s a few extra seconds of work. If you think it can be split out as an easy bug, go ahead and file it!</p>

<p>For example, whilst working on some <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/b677f0f4ae718c9c6953134bbed27656a6aeb48d">form issues</a>, instead of completely implementing something, I implemented just what I needed, and <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/7726">filed an easy bug</a>. <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/4534">This</a> is another bug with a very similar situation; I’d implemented the framework for form submission, made it work with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code>, and filed an easy bug for wiring it up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may not find a subfeature that can be split out, but you may notice something else which could be improved. <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/7517">This</a> is an example of such an issue. I was working on something else, and noticed that this area of the code could be designed better. Whilst I could have fixed it myself with very little effort as part of my other changes, I made it into an easy bug instead.</p>

<p><strong>Simple refactorings</strong> can be a source of easy bugs too. These require familiarity with the language, but not much more, so they’re ideal for people new to the project.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to take a hard bug and make it easier, either by partially implementing it, or giving enough hints (code links, explanations, etc) that the hard part is already taken care of.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid making “critical” (i.e, needs to land in a week or two) features into easy bugs</strong>. Even simple changes can take a while for new contributors (especially due to the nature of asynchronous communication, lack of time, and/or getting bogged down in the process). Easy bugs should be something which you <em>eventually</em> want, but are okay with it taking longer to solve. It’s very disheartening for a new contributor if they are working on something and a maintainer solves it for them because it was needed to land quickly. (Given enough time this will eventually happen for some bug, in such a case see if you can provide a different bug for them to work on and apologize)</p>

<h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3>

<p>Make it super easy for newcomers to <strong>find a bug they <em>want</em> to work on</strong>; not just any easy bug!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/">Bugs Ahoy</a> and <a href="http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/">What Can I do for Mozilla</a> are both great examples of this. Servo has <a href="http://servo.github.io/servo-starters/">servo-starters</a>.</p>

<p>There are also various sites where you can list your easy bugs, some of which are listed in <a href="http://edunham.net/2015/11/04/beyond_openhatch.html">Emily’s post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="projects-and-more-involved-participation">Projects and more involved participation</h3>

<p>Having easy bugs and mentoring newcomers is just one step. You probably want to have these newcomers working on harder stuff, projects, and perhaps eventually maintianing/reviewing!</p>

<p>For many people these steps may not necessarily require involvement from you; I’ve seen professional software developers move their way to being a maintainer with very little mentorship just because they’re experienced enough to figure out how the project works on their own.</p>

<p>However, many of your contributors may be students or otherwise inexperienced; indeed they may be contributing to your project to <em>gain</em> this experience and become better developers. Such people can become valuable members of the team with some effort.</p>

<p>This mostly involves <strong>nudging people towards harder bugs and/or projects</strong>. It’s also very valuable to maintain a list of “student projects” (noncritical but large bodies of work). These can be picked up by contributors or sometimes students wishing to do a project for course credit.</p>

<p>It’s important to <strong>try and provide a logical series of issues</strong> instead of picking things randomly around the project so that the contributor can focus on one part of the codebase while starting out. If the issues all culminate in a large feature, even better.</p>

<p>Joel Maher and the Mozilla Tools team <a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/hacking-on-a-defined-length-contribution-program/">have started a pretty great program called “Quarter of Contribution”</a> which provides focused mentorship for a particular project. It seems to work out well. Programs like Google Summer of Code and Outreachy also provide ways for new contributors to try out your project at a significant level of involvement.</p>

<p><em>Creating</em> such projects or harder bugs is a nontrivial problem, and I don’t have a clear idea on how this can be done (aside from using similar techniques as listed in the “creating easy bugs” section above). Ideas welcome!</p>

<p>Projects aren’t always necessary here either. Depending on the contributor, sometimes you can present them with a regular (i.e., not “easy” or otherwise earmarked) issue to work on, provide some hints, and tell them to try and figure stuff out without your help (or with less help). Stay involved, and encourage them to ask questions of others or initiate discussions, but try to stick to observing. It’s really fun to watch someone figure stuff out on their own. I did this with a contributor <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30377">here</a>, where I only provided the initial hint and the code review; as well as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/29989">here</a>, where I encouraged the contributor to initiate and direct the relevant bikeshedding on various channels without my involvement. The contributor is now more in touch with the Rust community and codebase as a result; and for me I enjoyed watching him figure stuff out and direct discussions on his own.</p>

<h2 id="mentor-share">Mentor! Share!</h2>

<p>I’m still exploring these techniques myself. I’ve had great results applying some of these to <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/">clippy</a>, and we already apply many of them to Servo. I’m <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/mentoring-newcomers-to-the-rust-ecosystem/3088">slowly working on applying these techniques to Rust</a>.</p>

<p>While some of these projects I’m always open to hearing about more ideas for making it easier for newcomers to contribute, so please let me know if you have any ideas or experiences to share!</p>

<p>Mentoring, while a lot of work, is an insanely rewarding experience, and I hope you try to incorporate it into your open source projects!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while I’ve been working on a <a href="http://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">garbage collector for Rust</a> with <a href="http://github.com/mystor">Nika
Layzell</a>. I thought this would be a good time to talk of our design and progress so far.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>“Wait”, you ask, “why does Rust need a garbage collector”? Rust is supposed to work <em>without</em> a GC,
that’s one of its main selling points!</p>

<p>True. Rust <em>does</em> work pretty well without a GC. It’s managed to do without one so far, and we still
have all sorts of well-written crates out there (none of which use a GC).</p>

<p>But Rust is not just about low-cost memory safety. It’s also <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/">about choosing your costs and
guarantees</a>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and stack allocation are not always sufficient, sometimes one needs to
reach for something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> (reference counting). But even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> is not perfect; it can’t handle
cycles between pointers. There are solutions to that issue like using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>, but that only works
in limited cases (when you know what the points-to graph looks like at compile time), and isn’t very
ergonomic.</p>

<p>Cases where one needs to maintain a complicated, dynamic graph are where a GC becomes useful.
Similarly, if one is writing an interpreter for a GCd language, having a GC in Rust would simplify
things a lot.</p>

<p>Not to say that one should pervasively use a GC in Rust. Similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, it’s best to use
regular ownership-based memory management as much as possible, and sprinkle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc</code> in places
where your code needs it.</p>

<h1 id="previous-designs">Previous designs</h1>

<p>This isn’t the first GC in Rust. Automatic memory management has existed before in various forms,
but all were limited.</p>

<p>Besides the ones listed below, Nick Fitzgerald’s <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/bacon-rajan-cc">cycle collector</a> based on <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon01Concurrent.pdf">this paper</a>
exists and is something that you should look into if you’re interested. There’s also <a href="https://github.com/pliniker/mo-gc/blob/master/doc/Project-RFC.md">an RFC</a>
by Peter Liniker which sketches out a design for an immutable GC.</p>

<h2 id="core-rust-gcs">Core Rust GC(s)</h2>

<p>Rust itself had a garbage collector until a bit more than a year ago. These “managed pointers”
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@T</code>) were part of the language. They were removed later with a plan to make GC a library feature.</p>

<p>I believe these were basically reference counted (cycle collected?) pointers with some language
integration, but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the only form of automatic memory management in Rust are via <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code></a>
which are nonatomic and atomic reference counted pointers respectively. In other words, they keep
track of the number of shared references via a reference count (incremented when it is cloned,
decremented when destructors run). If the reference count reaches zero, the contents are cleaned up.</p>

<p>This is a pretty useful abstraction, however, as mentioned above, it doesn’t let you create cycles
without leaking them.</p>

<h2 id="spidermonkey">Spidermonkey</h2>

<p><em>You can read more about Servo’s Spidermonkey bindings <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/08/26/javascript-servos-only-garbage-collector/">in this blog post</a> (somewhat
outdated, but still relevant)</em></p>

<p>In Servo we use <a href="http://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs/">bindings to the Spidermonkey Javascript engine</a>. Since Javascript is a
garbage collected language, the Rust representations of Javascript objects are also garbage
collected.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of GC isn’t really useful for generic use since it comes bundled with a JS
runtime. However, the Rust side of the GC is of a design that could be used in an independent
library.</p>

<p>The Rust side of the Spidermonkey GC is done through a bunch of smart pointers, and a trait called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSTraceable</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSTraceable</code> is a trait which can “trace” recursively down some data, finding and
marking all GC-managed objects inside it. This is autoderived using Rust’s plugin infrastructure, so
a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[jstraceable]</code> annotation will generate trace hooks for the struct it is on.</p>

<p>Now, we have various smart pointers. The first is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is opaque, but can be held by other
GC-managed structs. To use this on the stack, this must be explicitly <em>rooted</em>, via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.root()</code>. This
produces a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root&lt;T&gt;</code>, which can be dereferenced to get the inner object. When the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> is created,
the contained object is listed in a collection of “roots” in a global. A root indicates that the
value is being used on the stack somewhere, and the GC starts tracing usage from these roots. When
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root&lt;T&gt;</code> is destroyed, the root is removed.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> doesn’t work on the stack. There is no way for the GC to know
that we are holding on to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> on the stack. So, if I copy a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> to the stack, remove all
references to it from objects in the GC heap, and trigger a collection, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> will still be
around on the stack after collection since the GC can’t trace to it. If I attempt to root it, I may
get a panic or a segfault depending on the implementation.</p>

<p>To protect against this, we have a bunch of lints. The <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/plugins/lints/unrooted_must_root.rs">relevant one</a> here protects
against <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> from being carried around on the stack; but like most lints, it’s not perfect.</p>

<p>To summarize: Spidermonkey gives us a good GC. However using it for a generic Rust program is ill
advised. Additionally, Servo’s wrappers around the GC are cheap, but need lints for safety. While it
would probably be possible to write safer wrappers for general usage, it’s pretty impractical to
carry around a JS runtime when you don’t need one.</p>

<p>However, Spidermonkey’s GC did inspire me to think more into the matter.</p>

<h1 id="brainstorming-a-design">Brainstorming a design</h1>

<p>For quite a while I’d had various ideas about GCs. Most were simplifications of Servo’s wrappers
(there’s some complexity brought in there by Spidermonkey that’s not necessary for a general GC).
Most were tracing/rooting with mark-and-sweep collection. All of them used lints. Being rather busy,
I didn’t really work on it past that, but planned to work on it if I could find someone to work
with.</p>

<p>One day, <a href="http://github.com/mystor">Nika</a> pinged me on IRC and asked me about GCs. Lots of people knew that I was
interested in writing a GC for Rust, and one of them directed her to me when she expressed a similar
interest.</p>

<p>So we started discussing GCs. We settled on a tracing mark-and-sweep GC. In other words, the GC runs
regular “sweeps” where it first “traces” the usage of all objects and marks them and their children
as used, and then sweeps up all unused objects.</p>

<p>This model on its own has a flaw. It doesn’t know about GC pointers held on the stack as local
variables (“stack roots”). There are multiple methods for solving this. We’ve already seen one above
in the Spidermonkey design – maintain two types of pointers (one for the stack, one for the heap),
and try very hard using static analysis to ensure that they don’t cross over.</p>

<p>A common model (used by GCs like Boehm, called “conservative GCs”) is to do something called “stack
scanning”. In such a system, the GC goes down the stack looking for things which may perhaps be GC
pointers. Generally the GC allocates objects in known regions of the memory, so a GC pointer is any
value on the stack which belongs to one of these regions.</p>

<p>Of course, this makes garbage collection rather inefficient, and will miss cases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;Gc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>
where the GCd pointer is accessible, but through a non-GC pointer.</p>

<p>We decided rather early on that we didn’t want a GC based on lints or stack scanning. Both are
rather suboptimal solutions in my opinion, and very hard to make sound<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. We were also hoping that
Rust’s type system and ownership semantics could help us in designing a good, safe, API.</p>

<p>So, we needed a way to keep track of roots, and we needed a way to trace objects.</p>

<h2 id="tracing">Tracing</h2>

<p>The latter part was easy. We wrote a compiler plugin (well, we stole <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/plugins/jstraceable.rs#L38">Servo’s tracing plugin which
I’d written earlier</a>) which autoderives an implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait on any
given struct or enum, using the same internal infrastructure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[derive(PartialEq)]</code> and the
rest use. So, with just the following code, it’s easy to make a struct or enum gc-friendly:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Bar</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Baz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">Quux</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.trace()</code>, will expand to a call of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.x.trace()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.y.trace()</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar.trace()</code> will check which variant it is and call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u8</code> inside
if it’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Baz</code>. For most structs this turns out to be a no-op and is often optimized away by
inlining, but if a struct contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the special implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> will
“mark” the traceability of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>. Types without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> implemented cannot be used in types
implementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> or in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc</code>, which is enforced with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T: Trace</code> bound on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So, we have a way of walking the fields of a given object and finding inner <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s. Splendid. This
lets us write the mark&amp;sweep phase easily: Take the list of known reachable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s, walk their
contents until you find more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s (marking all you find), and clean up any which aren’t
reachable.</p>

<h2 id="rooting">Rooting</h2>

<p>Of course, now we have to solve the problem of keeping track of the known reachable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s, i.e.
the roots. This is a hard problem to solve without language support, and I hope that eventually we
might be able to get the language hooks necessary to solve it. LLVM <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GarbageCollection.html#gcroot">has support for tracking
GCthings on the stack</a>, and some day we may be able to leverage that in Rust.</p>

<p>As noted above, Spidermonkey’s solution was to have non-rooted (non-dereferencable) heap pointers,
which can be explicitly converted to rooted pointers and then read.</p>

<p>We went the other way. All <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> pointers, when created, are considered “rooted”. The instance of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> has a “rooted” bit set to true, and the underlying shared box (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcBox</code>, though this is not a
public interface) has its “root count” set to one.</p>

<p>When this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> is cloned, an identical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> (with rooted bit set to true) is returned, and the
underlying root count is incremented. Cloning a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc</code> does not perform a deep copy.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// a.root = true, (*a.ptr).roots = 1, (*a.ptr).data = 20</span>

<span class="c1">// ptr points to the underlying box, which contains the data as well as</span>
<span class="c1">// GC metadata like the root count. `Gc::new()` will allocate this box</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="nf">.clone</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// b.root = true, (*a.ptr).roots++, b.ptr = a.ptr</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is rather similar to how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> works, however there is no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> field, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roots</code> counter
is called a “reference counter”.</p>

<p>For regular local sharing, it is recommended to just use a borrowed reference to the inner variable
(borrowing works fine with rust-gc!) since there is no cost to creating this reference.</p>

<p>When a GC thing is put inside another GC thing, the first thing no longer can remain a root. This is
handled by “unrooting” the first GC thing:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u32</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">baz</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">u32</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// why anyone would want to GC an integer I'll never know</span>
                     <span class="c1">// but I'll stick with this example since it's simple</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">baz</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">});</span>
<span class="c1">// a.root = false, (*a.ptr).roots--</span>
<span class="c1">// b initialized similar to previous example</span>

<span class="c1">// `a` was moved into `b`, so now `a` cannot be accessed directly here</span>
<span class="c1">// other than through `b`, and `a` is no longer a root.</span>
<span class="c1">// To avoid moving a, passing `a.clone()` to `b` will work</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, we need a way to traverse the object passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>, in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>, and look
for any contained <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s to unroot. Sound familiar? This needs the same mechanism that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code>
needed! We add struct-walking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unroot()</code> methods to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait which are auto-
derived exactly the same way, and continue. (We don’t need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root()</code> right now, but we will need it
later on).</p>

<p>Now, during collection, we can just traverse the list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcBox</code>s and use the ones with a nonzero
root count as roots for our mark traversal.</p>

<p>So far, so good. We have a pretty sound design for a GC that works … for immutable data.</p>

<h3 id="mutability">Mutability</h3>

<p>Like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> is by default immutable. Rust abhors aliasable mutability, <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">even in single
threaded contexts</a>, and both these smart pointers allow aliasing.</p>

<p>Mutation poses a problem for our GC, beyond the regular problems of aliasable mutability: It’s
possible to move rooted things into heap objects and vice versa:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">None</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// uh oh, x is still considered rooted!</span>

<span class="c1">// and the reverse!</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)));</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="nf">.take</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// x was never rooted!</span>
<span class="c1">// `take()` moves the `Some(Gc&lt;u32&gt;)` out of `y`, replaces it with `None`       </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> doesn’t implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMut</code>, none of this is possible — one cannot mutate the
inner data. This is one of the places where Rust’s ownership/mutability system works out awesomely
in our favor.</p>

<p>Of course, an immutable GC isn’t very useful. We can’t even create cycles in an immutable GC, so why
would anyone need this in the first place<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>?</p>

<p>So of course, we needed to make it somehow mutable. People using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> solve this problem by using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, which maintains something similar to the borrow semantics at runtime and is internally
mutable. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> itself can’t be used by us since it doesn’t guard against the problem
illustrated above (and hence won’t implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>, but a similar cell type would work).</p>

<p>So we created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcCell&lt;T&gt;</code>. This behaves just like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, except that it will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root()</code> before
beginning a mutable borrow, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unroot()</code> before ending it (well, only if it itself is not rooted,
which is tracked by an internal field similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>). Now, everything is safe:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)});</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="py">.b</span><span class="nf">.borrow_mut</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// the `Gc(30)` from `y.b` was rooted by this call</span>
                           <span class="c1">// but since we don't actually use it here,</span>
                           <span class="c1">// the destructor gets rid of it.</span>

    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="c1">// x unrooted</span>
<span class="p">}</span>


<span class="c1">// and the reverse case works too:</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">GcCell</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">))));</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="nf">.borrow_mut</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="nf">.take</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// the inner `Some(Gc(20))` gets rooted by `borrow_mut()`</span>
                               <span class="c1">// before `x` can access it</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So now, mutation works too! We have a working garbage collector!</p>

<h1 id="open-problems">Open problems</h1>

<h2 id="destructors">Destructors</h2>

<p>I believe this can be solved without lints, but it <em>may</em> require some upcoming features of Rust to
be implemented first (like specialization).</p>

<p>In essence, destructors implemented on a value inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> can be unsafe. This will only happen
if they try to access values within a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> — if they do, they may come across a box that
has already been collected, or they may lengthen the lifetime of a box scheduled to be collected.</p>

<p>The basic solution to this is to use “finalizers” instead of destructors. Finalizers, like in Java,
are not guaranteed to run. However, we may need further drop hooks or trait specialization to make
an airtight interface for this. I don’t have a concrete design for this yet, though.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>

<p>Our model mostly just works in a concurrent situation (with thread safety tweaks, of course); in
fact it’s possible to make it so that the concurrent GC will not “stop the world” unless someone
tries to do a write to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcCell</code>. We have an experimental concurrent GC in <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/pull/6">this pull
request</a>. We still need to figure out how to make interop between both GCs safe, though we may
just end up making them such that an object using one GC cannot be fed to an object using the other.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>So far we haven’t really focused on performance, and worked on ensuring safety. Our collection
triggering algorithm, for example, was horribly inefficient, though we planned on improving it. The
wonderful Huon <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/pull/9">fixed this</a>, though.</p>

<p>Similarly, we haven’t yet optimized storage. We have some ideas which we may work on later. (If you
want to help, contributions welcome!)</p>

<h2 id="cross-crate-deriving">Cross-crate deriving</h2>

<p>Currently, an object deriving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> should have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>able children. This isn’t always possible
when members from another crate (which does not depend on rust-gc) are involved. At the moment, we
allow an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[unsafe_ignore_trace]</code> annotation on fields which are of this type (which excludes it
from being traced – if that crate doesn’t transitively depend on rust-gc, its members cannot
contain GCthings anyway unless generics are involved). It should be possible to detect whether or
not this is safe, and/or autoderive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> using the opt-in builtin traits framework (needs
specialization to work), but at the moment we don’t do anything other than expose that annotation.</p>

<p>Stdlib support for a global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait that everyone derives would be awesome.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Designing a GC was a wonderful experience! I didn’t get to write much code (I was busy and Nika
was able to implement most of it overnight because she’s totally awesome), but the long design
discussions followed by trying to figure out holes in the GC design in every idle moment of the day
were quite enjoyable. GCs are very hard to get right, but it’s very satisfying when you come up with
a design that works! I’m also quite happy at how well Rust helped in making a safe interface.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to try it out and/or find holes in our design. Contributions of all kind
welcome, we’d especially love performance improvements and testcases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I set up my Raspberry Pi as a music server so that I could listen to music without
having to deal with keeping my laptop in a certain corner of the room.</p>

<p>After setting it all up, it occurred to me: “I can do much more with this!”.</p>

<p>Waking up to go to class in the morning is always a challenge for me. It’s not that I don’t wake up
— I often wake up, cancel all the alarms, and go back to bed. Half-asleep me somehow has the
skill to turn off alarms, but not the discipline of going to class<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I’ve tried those apps that
make you do math before you can cancel the alarm, and I’m able to do the math and go back to sleep
without fully waking up in the process (Hey, I’m a physics student; math is what we do!).</p>

<p>So I decided to create an alarm clock. Not just any alarm clock, the most overengineered alarm clock
I can think of.</p>

<p>It consists of the Pi connected to a speaker and kept in a hard-to-reach area of the room. The Pi is
on a DHCP network. Every night, I ssh to the Pi, set the volume to full, and run a script which,
using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">at</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mpg123</code>, will schedule jobs to run around the desired time of waking up. First,
there will be a few pieces of soothing music (either violin music or parts of the <em>Interstellar</em>
OST) run once or twice, a while before the time of waking up. Close to the time of waking up, there
are a bunch of jobs where each one will run a string of annoying music. In my case, it’s the
Minions’ banana song followed by Nyan Cat (I sometimes add more to this list).</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now, the soothing music gives asleep-me me a chance to surrender and wake up <em>before</em> the Nyan Cat
begins, and often fear of Nyan Cat is a pretty good motivator to wake up. If I don’t wake up to
the soft songs, the annoying ones invariably work.</p>

<p>At this stage I’m still pretty groggy and have the intense urge to go back to bed. However, turning
off the alarm isn’t simple. Since it’s in a hard to reach area of the room, I can’t just turn it
off. I need to get up, sit in my chair, and turn on the laptop (which is hibernated/suspended), and
kill it via ssh.</p>

<p>This needs me to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code> the network to find the Pi (I’m the only one on this subnet who uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>, so this just needs a port filter)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> into the Pi, remembering the password (I haven’t done this yet but I could further complicate things by changing the password often to reduce muscle-memory)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">killall mpg123</code> to kill the currently playing song</li>
  <li>Cancel the remaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">at</code> jobs. This can be done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atq</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atrm</code> for every job (tedious and long), or with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code>. If I’ve already fully woken up, I’m able to do the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code> one, otherwise half-asleep me ends up doing the brute-force one, which is enough manual typing to shake the remaining bits of sleepiness off.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this whole process, it’s pretty much guaranteed that I’m fully awake – there’s no going back now!</p>

<p>So far it’s worked pretty well (both when I’ve slept on time and when I haven’t). The first ten minutes after this I’m rather annoyed, but after that I’m happy I woke up. If half-asleep me
eventually gets the muscle memory to get past this process, I should probably be able to tweak it
to add more complexity or change the way it works.</p>

<p>Of course, having an arms race with oneself probably isn’t the best way to solve this problem. I
suspect I’ll go back to regular alarms in a month or so, but it’s a fun experiment for now.</p>

<p>However, by the time I’m done with this alarm clock, I’ll either be waking up on time, or I’ll be
able to Linux in my sleep, which is a win-win!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while now I’ve been quite interested in compilers and systems programming in general; and I
feel that an important feature of systems programming is that it’s relatively easy to figure out
what a line of code does (modulo optimizations) at the OS or hardware level<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Conversely, it’s
important to know how your tools work more than ever in systems programming. So when I see a
language feature I’m not familiar with, I’m interested in finding out how it works under the hood.</p>

<p>I’m not a C++ expert. I can work on C++ codebases, but I’m not anywhere near knowing all of the
features and nuances of C++. However, I am pretty good at Rust and understand a decent portion of
the compiler internals. This gives me a great perspective — I’ve not yet internalized most C++
features to take them for granted, and I’m well equipped to investigate these features.</p>

<p>Today I came across some C++ code similar to the following<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">SomeType</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">OtherType</span> <span class="n">baz</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">otherMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code piqued my interest. Specifically, the local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> stuff. I knew that when you have a
static like</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>static int FOO = 1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> is stored somewhere in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.data</code> section of the program. This is easily verified with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">THING</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xAAAA</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ g++ test.cpp -g
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601038.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601038
THING in section .data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is basically a part of the compiled program as it is loaded into memory.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> that is initialized with a function, it’s stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bss</code>
section, and initialized before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code>. Again, easily verified:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include</span><span class="cpf">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="n">cout</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="s">"bar called</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>We can also leave statics uninitialized (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static int THING;</code>) and they will be placed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bss</code><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now back to the original snippet:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>Naïvely one might say that these are statics which are scoped locally to avoid name clashes. It’s
not much different from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static THING = bar()</code> aside from the fact that it isn’t a global
identifier.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t the case. What tipped me off was that this called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Env()</code>, and I wasn’t so sure
that the environment was guaranteed to be properly initialized and available before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> is
called <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Instead, these are statics which are initialized the first time the function is called.</p>

<p>The instruction at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+44</code> calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code>, and it seems to be surrounded by calls to some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard</code>
functions.</p>

<p>We can take a naïve guess at what this does: It probably just sets a hidden static flag on
initialization which ensures that it only runs once.</p>

<p>Of course, the actual solution isn’t as simple. It needs to avoid data races, handle errors, and
somehow take care of recursive initialization.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <a href="http://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#once-ctor">spec</a> and one <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">implementation</a>, found by searching for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard</code>.</p>

<p>Both of them show us the generated code for initializing things like local statics:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj_guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">first_byte</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj_guard</code> is our “hidden static flag”, with some other extra data.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard_acquire</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard_release</code> acquire and release a lock to prevent recursive

<p>Over here, to initialize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code> needs to be called, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code> calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo()</code> which needs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>
to be initialized, which again will call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code> (though this time it won’t recurse). If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> wasn’t
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> it would be fine, but now we have two calls trying to initialize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, and it’s unclear as
to which value should be used.</p>

<p>The implementation is pretty interesting. Before looking at the code my quick guess was that the
following would happen for local statics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj_guard</code> is a struct containing a mutex and a flag with three states:
“uninitialized”, “initializing”, and “initialized”. Alternatively, use an atomic state indicator.</li>
  <li>When we try to initialize for the first time, the mutex is locked, the flag is set
to “initializing”, the mutex is released, the value is initialized, and the flag is set to “initialized”.</li>
  <li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is “initialized”, don’t initialize again</li>
  <li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is “initializing”, throw some exception</li>
</ul>

<p>(We need the tristate flag because without it recursion would cause deadlocks)</p>

<p>I suppose that this implementation would work, though it’s not the one being used. The
<a href="https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/master/libc/bionic/__cxa_guard.cpp">implementation in bionic</a> (the Android version of the C stdlib) is similar; it
uses per-static atomics which indicate various states. However, it does not throw an exception when
we have a recursive initialization, it instead seems to deadlock<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This is okay because the C++
spec says (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n2356/stmt.html#stmt.dcl">Section 6.7.4</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being initialized, the
behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the implementations in <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/guard.cc">gcc/libstdc++</a> (also <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">this version</a> of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcppabi</code> from Apple, which is a bit more readable) do something different. They use a global
recursive mutex to handle reentrancy. Recursive mutexes basically can be locked multiple times by a
single thread, but cannot be locked by another thread till the locking thread unlocks them the same
number of times. This means that recursion/reentrancy won’t cause deadlocks, but we still have one-
thread-at-a-time access. What these implementations do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard_object</code> is a set of two flags, one which indicates if the static is initialized,
and one which indicates that the static is being initialized (“in use”)</li>
  <li>If the object is initialized, do nothing (this doesn’t use mutexes and is cheap).
This isn’t exactly part of the implementation in the library, but is part of the generated code.</li>
  <li>If it isn’t initialized, acquire the global recursive lock</li>
  <li>If the object is initialized by the time the lock was acquired, unlock and return</li>
  <li>If not, check if the static is being initialized from the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard_object</code> flag. If it is
“in use”, throw an exception.</li>
  <li>If it wasn’t, mark the second flag of the static’s guard object as being “in use”</li>
  <li>Call the initialization function, bubble errors</li>
  <li>Unlock the global mutex</li>
  <li>Mark the second flag as “not in use”</li>
</ul>

<p>At any one time, only one thread will be in the process of running initialization routines, due to
the global recursive mutex. Since the mutex is recursive, a function (eg <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar()</code>) used for
initializing local statics may itself use (different) local statics. Due to the “in use” flag, the
initialization of a local static may not recursively call its parent function without causing an
error.</p>

<p>This doesn’t need per-static atomics, and doesn’t deadlock, however it has the cost of a global
mutex which is called at most once per local static. In a highly threaded situation with lots of
such statics, one might want to reevaluate directly using local statics.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxxabi/blob/master/src/cxa_guard.cpp#L188">LLVM’s libcxxabi</a> is similar to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libstdc++</code> implementation, but instead of a recursive
mutex it uses a regular mutex (on non-ARM Apple systems) which is unlocked before
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__cxa_guard_acquire</code> exits and tests for reentrancy by noting the thread ID in the guard object
instead of the “in use” flag. Condvars are used for waiting for a thread to stop using an object. On
other platforms, it seems to deadlock, though I’m not sure.</p>

<p>So here we have a rather innocent-looking feature that has some hidden costs and pitfalls. But now I
can look at a line of code where this feature is being used, and have a good idea of what’s
happening there. One step closer to being a better systems programmer!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In every talk I have given till now, the question “how does Rust achieve thread safety?”
has invariably come up<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I usually just give an overview, but this provides a more comprehensive
explanation for those who are interested</em></p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/02/some-notes-on-send-and-sync/">Huon’s blog post on the same topic</a></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/">previous post</a> I touched a bit on the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code></a> trait. There are other such
“marker” traits in the standard library, and the ones relevant to this discussion are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>
and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>. I recommend reading that post if you’re not familiar with Rust wrapper types
like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a>, since I’ll be using them as examples throughout this post;
but the concepts explained here are largely independent.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this post, I’ll restrict thread safety to mean no data races or cross-thread
dangling pointers. Rust doesn’t aim to solve race conditions. However, there are projects which
utilize the type system to provide some form of extra safety, for example <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-
sessions</a> attempts to provide protocol safety using
session types.</p>

<p>These traits are auto-implemented using a feature called “opt in builtin traits”. So, for example,
if struct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> contains only <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> fields, it will also be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>, unless we
explicitly opt out using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impl !Sync for Foo {}</code>. Similarly, if struct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> contains at least one
non-<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> type, it will not be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> either, unless it explicitly opts in (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe
impl Sync for Foo {}</code>)</p>

<p>This means that, for example, a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a> for a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> type is itself
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>, but a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a> for a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> type will not be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>. This
pattern is quite powerful; it lets one use channels with non-threadsafe data in a single-threaded
context without requiring a separate “single threaded” channel abstraction.</p>

<p>At the same time, structs like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> which contain
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>/<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> fields have explicitly opted out of one or more of these because the
invariants they rely on do not hold in threaded situations.</p>

<p>It’s actually possible to design your own library with comparable thread safety guarantees outside
of the compiler — while these marker traits are specially treated by the compiler, the special
treatment is not necessary for their working. Any two opt-in builtin traits could be used here.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> have slightly differing meanings, but are very intertwined.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> types can be moved between threads without an issue. It answers the question
“if this variable were moved to another thread, would it still be valid for use?”.
Most objects which completely own their contained data qualify here. Notably, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> doesn’t
(since it is shared ownership). Another exception is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/thread/struct.LocalKey.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LocalKey</code></a>, which
<em>does</em> own its data but isn’t valid from other threads. Borrowed data does qualify to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>, but
in most cases it can’t be sent across threads due to a constraint that will be touched upon later.</p>

<p>Even though types like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> use non-atomic reference counting, it can be sent safely
between threads because this is a transfer of <em>ownership</em> (a move). Sending a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a> to another thread
will be a move and will make it unusable from the original thread; so this is fine.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>, on the other hand, is about synchronous access. It answers the question: “if
multiple threads were all trying to access this data, would it be safe?”. Types like
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code></a> and other lock/atomic based types implement this, along with primitive types.
Things containing pointers generally are not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> is sort of a crutch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>; it helps make other types <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> when sharing is
involved. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> are only <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> when the inner data is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> (there’s an additional
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> bound in the case of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>). In words, stuff that has shared/borrowed ownership can be sent
to another thread if the shared/borrowed data is synchronous-safe.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code></a>, while <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>, is not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> because of the non atomic reference counting.</p>

<p>Bringing it together, the gatekeeper for all this is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thread::spawn()</code></a>. It has the signature</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">spawn</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">F</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">JoinHandle</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">FnOnce</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Send</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">'static</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Send</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">'static</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, this is confusing/noisy, partially because it’s allowed to return a value, and also because
it returns a handle from which we can block on a thread join. We can conjure a simpler <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spawn</code> API for our needs though:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">spawn</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">F</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">FnOnce</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Send</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">'static</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which can be called like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="c1">// `move` instructs the closure to move out of its environment</span>
<span class="nn">thread</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">spawn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">move</span> <span class="p">||</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="c1">// x is not accessible here since it was moved</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In words, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spawn()</code> will take a callable (usually a closure) that will be called once, and contains
data which is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>. Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> just means that there is no borrowed
data contained in the closure. This is the aforementioned constraint that prevents the sharing of
borrowed data across threads; without it we would be able to send a borrowed pointer to a thread that
could easily outlive the borrow, causing safety issues.</p>

<p>There’s a slight nuance here about the closures — closures can capture outer variables,
but by default they do so by-reference (hence the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move</code> keyword). They autoimplement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>
and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> depending on their capture clauses. For more on their internal representation,
see <a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/">huon’s post</a>. In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> was captured by-move; i.e. as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>
(instead of being similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> or something), so the closure itself can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>.
Without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move</code> keyword, the closure would not be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> since it contains borrowed
content.</p>

<p>Since the closure inherits the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>-ness of its captured data, a closure
capturing data of the correct type will satisfy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F: Send+'static</code> bound.</p>

<p>Some examples of things that are allowed and not allowed by this function (for the type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> are allowed because they are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> (when the inner type is of the same kind)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> isn’t allowed because it’s not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>. This is good, because borrows should have a statically-known lifetime. Sending a borrowed pointer to a thread may lead to a use after free, or otherwise break aliasing rules.</li>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> isn’t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>, so it isn’t allowed. We could have some other <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>s hanging around, and end up with a data race on the refcount.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;</code> is allowed (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> if the inner type is); we can’t cause a safety violation here. Iterator invalidation requires mutation, and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> doesn’t provide this by default.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> isn’t allowed. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provides copying-based internal mutability, and isn’t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> (so the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> isn’t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code></a>). If this were allowed, we could have cases where larger structs are getting written to from different threads simultaneously resulting in some random mishmash of the two. In other words, a data race.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> are allowed (for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>). The inner types use threadsafe locks and provide lock-based internal mutability. They can guarantee that only one thread is writing to them at any point in time. For this reason, the mutexes are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> regardless of the inner <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> (as long as it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>), and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> types can be shared safely with wrappers like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code></a>. From the point of view of the inner type, it’s only being accessed by one thread at a time (slightly more complex in the case of <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code></a>), so it doesn’t need to know about the threads involved. There can’t be data races when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> types like these are involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, you can in fact create a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a>/<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Receiver</code></a> pair of non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> objects. This sounds a bit
counterintuitive — shouldn’t we be only sending values which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>? However, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is only
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>; so even if we can use a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sender</code></a> of a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> type, we cannot send it to another thread,
so it cannot be used to violate thread safety.</p>

<p>There is also a way to utilize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>-ness of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> (which is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code>) for some <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code></a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, namely <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.scoped.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thread::scoped</code></a>.
This function does not have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'static</code> bound, but it instead has an RAII guard which forces a join before the borrow ends. This
allows for easy fork-join parallelism without necessarily needing a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code></a>.
Sadly, there <a href="http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/everyone-peaches/">are</a> <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/04/29/on-reference-counting-and-leaks/">problems</a> which crop up when this interacts with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> cycles, so the API
is currently unstable and will be redesigned. This is not a problem with the language design or the design of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code>,
rather it is a perfect storm of small design inconsistencies in the libraries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More than a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">year ago</a> I blogged (and <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/04/50-more-shades-of-green.html">blogged again</a> later) about my
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth">ongoing github streak</a>.</p>

<p>The GitHub streak has since gone on for more than 500 days<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and has been a really enriching experience.</p>

<p>Yesterday; I noticed something. I had reached end-game with this exercise. The streak is something I don’t think about anymore,
and I don’t make any efforts to keep it going. It just … happens. My involvement in open source has reached a level where
I don’t need to consciously try contributing daily; I have enough interests/responsibilities that the streak is a side effect. This is despite
my current internship being at a place where the code I’m working on is not hosted on GitHub (unlike last year). If the streak breaks, I won’t
particularly care; and I <em>haven’t</em> been caring for a while now.</p>

<p>… I think that’s amazing. Despite me not realizing it at the time, this is the state of affairs that such an exercise would ideally
lead to — the initial motivation for the exercise replaced with something more substantial, until the excercise is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>I initially started this off after realizing that I had inadvertantly been contributing daily to open source for a week or so. In the past, my
contributions to open source used to be in bursts, which meant that I would be out of touch at times. I decided to try and work on extending this.
After around 30 days, I had a concrete habit. After around 40, I realized that I’d become much more efficient at working on random bugs (even in unfamiliar codebases),
thus being able to spend more time writing real code.</p>

<p>Initially I had set a bunch of rules (listed in my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">original post</a>), which had stuff like issues/readme edits not counting (and no date manipulation!). I tweaked the rules around the 80-mark
to include issues/readmes when I had written code that day but it was lost in a commit squash or rebase. I think much later I dropped the rules about issues and readme edits entirely;
just considering “anything that shows up on the punchcard which is not a result of date manipulation” to be valid. At that point I was already quite involved in multiple projects
and didn’t care so much about the streak or the original rules — it was just a habit at that point.</p>

<p>Now, I’m a regular contributor to both the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> projects. I also have a bunch of personal projects (<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-tenacious">lints</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-extensible">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-adorn">syntax extensions</a> for Rust, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">gc</a>, along with a lot of older projects that I don’t actively work on but maintain) and am trying to regularly blog. I’ve
also gotten well into the habit of sending pull requests for fixing mistakes or annoyances. When all this comes together, I end up with at least one contribution a day. Sometimes more.
I have tons of things queued that I want to work on (both personal and as a part of Servo/Rust/elsewhere), if only I had the time.</p>

<p>If you do have enough spare time, I do recommend trying this. Once you get enough momentum the power of habit will keep it going, and if
my case is anything of an indicator<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> you’ll eventually have a good chunk of contributions and some concrete open source involvement.</p>

<p>Please note that GitHub streaks shouldn’t be used as a metric, <em>ever</em>. They’re great for self motivation. As a metric for tracking employee performance,
or for filtering interview candidates; not so much. It’s way too rough a metric (like LoC written), and oversimplifies the work that goes into code.
As far as using it to boost interview candidates; not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source after a day job in programming,
and <em>that’s okay</em>. I’m a physics student — programming is like a hobby for me<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> which I’ll gladly do daily. Now that I have a programming intern,
I’m pretty sure there will be days where I don’t want to program further after leaving the office.</p>

    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This post is now <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/choosing-your-guarantees.html">a part of the official rust book</a></em></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a> I talked a bit about why the RWlock pattern is important for
accessing data, which is why Rust enforces this pattern either at compile time or runtime
depending on the abstractions used.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that there are many such abstractions in Rust, each with their unique guarantees.
The programmer once again has the choice between runtime and compile time enforcement. It occurred
to me that this plethora of “wrapper types”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> could be daunting to newcomers; in this post I intend
to give a thorough explanation of what some prominent ones do and when they should be used.</p>

<p>I’m assuming the reader knows about <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">ownership</a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrowing</a> in Rust.
Nevertheless, I will attempt to keep the majority of this post accessible to those not yet familiar with these
concepts. Aside from the two links into the book above, <a href="http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/">these</a> <a href="http://arthurtw.github.io/2014/11/30/rust-borrow-lifetimes.html">two</a> blog posts cover
the topic in depth.</p>

<h1 id="basic-pointer-types">Basic pointer types</h1>

<h2 id="boxt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is an “owned pointer” or a “box”. While it can hand out borrowed references to the data, it is the only
owner of the data. In particular, when something like the following occurs:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Box</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">// x no longer accessible here</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the box was <em>moved</em> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>. As <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> no longer owns it,
the compiler will no longer allow the programmer to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> after this. A box
can similarly be moved <em>out</em> of a function by returning, and when a
box (one which hasn’t been moved) goes out of scope, destructors are run, deallocating
the inner data.</p>

<p>This abstraction is a low cost abstraction for dynamic allocation. If you want
to allocate some memory on the heap and safely pass a pointer to that memory around, this
is ideal. Note that you will only be allowed to share borrowed references to this by
the regular borrowing rules, checked at compile time.</p>

<h4 id="interlude-copy">Interlude: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code></h4>

<p>Move/ownership semantics are not special to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code>; it is a feature of all types which are not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>.</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> type is one where all the data it logically encompasses (usually, owns) is part of its stack
representation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Most types containing pointers to other data are not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>, since there is additional data
elsewhere, and simply copying the stack representation may accidentally share ownership of that data
in an unsafe manner.</p>

<p>Types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code> which also have data on the heap are also not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>. Types
like the integer/boolean types are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and raw pointers <em>are</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>. Even though they do point
to further data, they do not “own” that data. Whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> can be thought of as
“some data which happens to be dynamically allocated”, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> is thought of as “a borrowing reference
to some data”. Even though both are pointers, only the first is considered to be “data”. Hence,
a copy of the first should involve a copy of the data (which is not part of its stack representation),
but a copy of the second only needs a copy of the reference. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> because mutable aliases
cannot be shared, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> “owns” the data it points to somewhat since it can mutate.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, a type can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> if a copy of its stack representation doesn’t violate
memory safety.</p>

<h2 id="t-and-mut-t"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are immutable and mutable references respectively. They follow the “read-write lock” pattern
described in my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a>, such that one may either have only one mutable reference
to some data, or any number of immutable ones, but not both. This guarantee is enforced at compile time,
and has no visible cost at runtime. In most cases such pointers suffice for sharing cheap references between
sections of code.</p>

<p>These pointers cannot be copied in such a way that they outlive the lifetime associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="const-t-and-mut-t"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*const T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are C-like raw pointers with no lifetime or ownership attached to them. They just point to some location
in memory with no other restrictions. The only guarantee that these provide is that they cannot be dereferenced
except in code marked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code>.</p>

<p>These are useful when building safe, low cost abstractions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but should be avoided in safe code.</p>

<h2 id="rct"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p>This is the first wrapper we will cover that has a runtime cost.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a reference counted pointer. In other words, this lets us have multiple “owning” pointers
to the same data, and the data will be freed (destructors will be run) when all pointers are out of scope.</p>

<p>Internally, it contains a shared “reference count”, which is incremented each time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> is cloned, and decremented
each time one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>s goes out of scope. The main responsibility of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is to ensure that destructors are called
for shared data.</p>

<p>The internal data here is immutable, and if a cycle of references is created, the data will be leaked. If we want
data that doesn’t leak when there are cycles, we need a <em>garbage collector</em>. I do not know of any existing GCs in Rust,
but <a href="http://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc">I am working on one with Nika Layzell</a> and there’s <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/rajan-bacon-cc">another cycle collecting one</a> being written by Nick
Fitzgerald.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h4>

<p>The main guarantee provided here is that the data will not be destroyed until all references to it are out of scope.</p>

<p>This should be used when you wish to dynamically allocate and share some data (read-only) between various portions
of your program, where it is not certain which portion will finish using the pointer last. It’s a viable alternative
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> is either impossible to statically check for correctness, or creates extremely unergonomic code where
the programmer does not wish to spend the development cost of working with.</p>

<p>This pointer is <em>not</em> thread safe, and Rust will not let it be sent or shared with other threads. This lets
one avoid the cost of atomics in situations where they are unnecessary.</p>

<p>There is a sister smart pointer to this one, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is a non-owning, but also non-borrowed, smart pointer.
It is also similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code>, but it is not restricted in lifetime — a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> can be held on to forever. However,
it is possible that an attempt to access the inner data may fail and return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>, since this can outlive the owned
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>s. This is useful for when one wants cyclic data structures and other things.</p>

<h4 id="cost">Cost</h4>

<p>As far as memory goes, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is a single allocation, though it will allocate two extra words as compared to
a regular <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> (for “strong” and “weak” refcounts).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> has the computational cost of incrementing/decrementing the refcount whenever it is cloned or goes out of
scope respectively. Note that a clone will not do a deep copy, rather it will simply increment the inner reference count
and return a copy of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<h1 id="cell-types">Cell types</h1>

<p>“Cells” provide interior mutability. In other words, they contain data which can be manipulated even
if the type cannot be obtained in a mutable form (for example, when it is behind an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>-ptr or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/">The documentation for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cell</code> module has a pretty good explanation for these</a>.</p>

<p>These types are <em>generally</em> found in struct fields, but they may be found elsewhere too.</p>

<h2 id="cellt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a type that provides zero-cost interior mutability, but only for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types.
Since the compiler knows that all the data owned by the contained value is on the stack, there’s
no worry of leaking any data behind references (or worse!) by simply replacing the data.</p>

<p>It is still possible to violate your own invariants using this wrapper, so be careful when
using it. If a field is wrapped in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code>, it’s a nice indicator that the chunk of data is mutable
and may not stay the same between the time you first read it and when you intend to use it.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Cell</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">y</span><span class="nf">.set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">z</span><span class="nf">.set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.get</span><span class="p">());</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that here we were able to mutate the same value from various immutable references.</p>

<p>This has the same runtime cost as the following:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but it has the added benefit of actually compiling successfully.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-1">Guarantees</h4>

<p>This relaxes the “no aliasing with mutability” restriction in places where it’s
unnecessary. However, this also relaxes the guarantees that the restriction provides;
so if one’s invariants depend on data stored within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code>, one should be careful.</p>

<p>This is useful for mutating primitives and other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types when there is no easy way of
doing it in line with the static rules of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/378tj6/blog_post_review_requested_container_types/crlfl74">Gábor Lehel</a> summed up the guarantees provided by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> in a rather succinct manner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic guarantee we need to ensure is that interior references can’t be invalidated (left dangling)
by mutation of the outer structure. (Think about references to the interiors of types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>, etc.) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut</code>, and Cell each make a different tradeoff here.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> allows shared interior references but forbids mutation;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut</code> allows mutation xor interior references but not sharing;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> allows shared mutability but not interior references.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, while shared mutability can cause many logical errors (as outlined in <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">my previous post
</a>), it can only cause memory safety errors when coupled with “interior references”. This
is for types who have an “interior” whose type/size can itself be changed. One example of this is a
Rust enum; where by changing the variant you can change what type is contained. If you have an alias
to the inner type whilst the variant is changed, pointers within that alias may be invalidated.
Similarly, if you change the length of a vector while you have an alias to one of its elements, that
alias may be invalidated.</p>

<p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> doesn’t allow references to the insides of a type (you can only copy out and copy back
in), enums and structs alike are safe to be aliased mutably within this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/32ypxp/questions_about_mutability/cqfwl3h">This comment by Eddy also touches on the guarantees of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> and the alternatives</a></p>

<h4 id="cost-1">Cost</h4>

<p>There is no runtime cost to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, however if one is using it
to wrap larger (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>) structs, it might be worthwhile to instead wrap individual
fields in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> since each write is a full copy of the struct.</p>

<h2 id="refcellt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> also provides interior mutability, but isn’t restricted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code> types.</p>

<p>Instead, it has a runtime cost. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> enforces the RWLock pattern at runtime (it’s like a single-threaded mutex),
unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> which do so at compile time. This is done by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">borrow()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">borrow_mut()</code> functions, which modify an internal reference count and return smart pointers
which can be dereferenced immutably and mutably respectively. The refcount is restored
when the smart pointers go out of scope. With this system, we can dynamically ensure that
there are never any other borrows active when a mutable borrow is active. If the programmer
attempts to make such a borrow, the thread will panic.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">RefCell</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{:?}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.borrow</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">my_ref</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.borrow_mut</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">my_ref</span><span class="nf">.push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code>, this is mainly useful for situations where it’s hard or impossible to satisfy the
borrow checker. Generally one knows that such mutations won’t happen in a nested form, but it’s good
to check.</p>

<p>For large, complicated programs, it becomes useful to put some things in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code>s to
make things simpler. For example, a lot of the maps in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/620d1ee5346bee10ba7ce129b2e20d6e59f0377d/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs#L803-L987">the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctxt</code> struct</a> in the rust compiler
internals are inside this wrapper. These are only modified once (during creation, which is not
right after initialization) or a couple of times in well-separated places. However, since this struct is
pervasively used everywhere, juggling mutable and immutable pointers would be hard (perhaps impossible)
and probably form a soup of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>-ptrs which would be hard to extend. On the other hand, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code>
provides a cheap (not zero-cost) way of safely accessing these. In the future, if someone adds some code
that attempts to modify the cell when it’s already borrowed, it will cause a (usually deterministic) panic
which can be traced back to the offending borrow.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Servo’s DOM we have a lot of mutation, most of which is local to a DOM type, but
some of which crisscrosses the DOM and modifies various things. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> to guard
all mutation lets us avoid worrying about mutability everywhere, and it simultaneously
highlights the places where mutation is <em>actually</em> happening.</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> should be avoided if a mostly simple solution is possible with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> pointers.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-2">Guarantees</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> relaxes the <em>static</em> restrictions preventing aliased mutation, and
replaces them with <em>dynamic</em> ones. As such the guarantees have not changed.</p>

<h4 id="cost-2">Cost</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> does not allocate, but it contains an additional “borrow state”
indicator (one word in size) along with the data.</p>

<p>At runtime each borrow causes a modification/check of the refcount.</p>

<h1 id="synchronous-types">Synchronous types</h1>

<p>Many of the types above cannot be used in a threadsafe manner. Particularly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>,
which both use non-atomic ref counts, cannot be used this way. This makes them cheaper to use, but one
needs thread safe versions of these too. They exist, in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RWLock&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that the non-threadsafe types <em>cannot</em> be sent between threads, and this is checked at compile time.
I’ll touch on how this is done in a later blog post.</p>

<p>There are many useful wrappers for concurrent programming in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/index.html">sync</a> module, but I’m only going to cover
the major ones.</p>

<h2 id="arct"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is just a version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that uses an atomic reference count (hence, “Arc”). This can be sent
freely between threads.</p>

<p>C++’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared_ptr</code> is similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code>, however in C++s case the inner data is always mutable. For semantics
similar to that from C++, we should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
is a cell type that can be used to hold any data and has no runtime cost, but accessing it requires <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> blocks).
The last one should only be used if one is certain that the usage won’t cause any memory unsafety. Remember that
writing to a struct is not an atomic operation, and many functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec.push()</code> can reallocate internally
and cause unsafe behavior (so even monotonicity<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> may not be enough to justify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UnsafeCell</code>)</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-3">Guarantees</h4>

<p>Like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>, this provides the (thread safe) guarantee that the destructor for the internal data
will be run when the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code> goes out of scope (barring any cycles).</p>

<h4 id="cost-3">Cost</h4>
<p>This has the added cost of using atomics for changing the refcount (which will happen whenever it is cloned
or goes out of scope). When sharing data from an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code> in
a single thread, it is preferable to share <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> pointers whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id="mutext-and-rwlockt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provide mutual-exclusion via RAII guards. For both of these, the
mutex is opaque until one calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lock()</code> on it, at which point the thread will
block until a lock can be acquired, and then a guard will be returned. This guard
can be used to access the inner data (mutably), and the lock will be released when the
guard goes out of scope.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">guard</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mutex</span><span class="nf">.lock</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// guard dereferences mutably to the inner type</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">guard</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">// lock released when destructor runs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code> has the added benefit of being efficient for multiple reads. It is always
safe to have multiple readers to shared data as long as there are no writers; and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code>
lets readers acquire a “read lock”. Such locks can be acquired concurrently and are kept track of
via a reference count. Writers must obtain a “write lock” which can only be obtained when all readers
have gone out of scope.</p>

<h4 id="guarantees-4">Guarantees</h4>
<p>Both of these provide safe shared mutability across threads, however they are prone to deadlocks.
Some level of additional protocol safety can be obtained via the type system. An example 
of this is <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-sessions</a>, an experimental library which uses session
types for protocol safety.</p>

<h4 id="costs">Costs</h4>

<p>These use internal atomic-like types to maintain the locks, and these are similar pretty
costly (they can block all memory reads across processors till they’re done). Waiting on these locks
can also be slow when there’s a lot of concurrent access happening.</p>

<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>

<p>A common gripe when reading Rust code is with stuff like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and more complicated
compositions of such types.</p>

<p>Usually, it’s a case of composing together the guarantees that one needs, without paying for stuff that is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> is one such composition. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> itself can’t be dereferenced mutably;
because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> provides sharing and shared mutability isn’t good, so we put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> inside to get
dynamically verified shared mutability. Now we have shared mutable data, but it’s shared in a way
that there can only be one mutator (and no readers) or multiple readers.</p>

<p>Now, we can take this a step further, and have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
These are both shareable, mutable vectors, but they’re not the same.</p>

<p>With the former, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code> is wrapping the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>, so the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code> in its entirety is mutable.
At the same time, there can only be one mutable borrow of the whole <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code> at a given time. This
means that your code cannot simultaneously work on different elements of the vector from different
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> handles. However, we are able to push and pop from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code> at will. This is similar to an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
with the borrow checking done at runtime.</p>

<p>With the latter, the borrowing is of individual elements, but the overall vector is immutable.
Thus, we can independently borrow separate elements, but we cannot push or pop from the vector.
This is similar to an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut [T]</code><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, but, again, the borrow checking is at runtime.</p>

<p>In concurrent programs, we have a similar situation with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, which provides shared
mutability and ownership.</p>

<p>When reading code that uses these, go in step by step and look at the guarantees/costs provided.</p>

<p>When choosing a composed type, we must do the reverse; figure out which guarantees we want, and at which
point of the composition we need them. For example, if there is a choice between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,
we should figure out the tradeoffs as done above and pick one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Edit (Jan 2017): I re-discovered <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/on-the-connection-between-memory-management-and-data-race-freedom/">Niko’s post</a> which touches on this and reaches for the same realization. I suspect I subconsciously got the idea for this from that post, at least in part.</em></p>

<p>This is a post that I’ve been meaning to write for a while now; and the release of Rust 1.0 gives
me the perfect impetus to go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>Whilst this post discusses a choice made in the design of Rust; and uses examples in Rust; the principles discussed
here apply to other languages for the most part. I’ll also try to make the post easy to understand for those without
a Rust background; please let me know if some code or terminology needs to be explained.</p>

<p>What I’m going to discuss here is the choice made in Rust to disallow having multiple mutable aliases
to the same data (or a mutable alias when there are active immutable aliases),
<strong>even from the same thread</strong>. In essence, it disallows one from doing things like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Vec</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is essentially the “Read-Write lock” (RWLock) pattern, except it’s not being used in a
threaded context, and the “locks” are done via static analysis (compile time “borrow checking”).</p>

<p>Newcomers to the language have the recurring question as to why this exists. <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ownership.html">Ownership semantics</a>
and immutable <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrows</a> can be grasped because there are concrete examples from languages like C++ of
problems that these concepts prevent. It makes sense that having only one “owner” and then multiple “borrowers” who
are statically guaranteed to not stick around longer than the owner will prevent things like use-after-free.</p>

<p>But what could possibly be wrong with having multiple handles for mutating an object? Why do we need an RWLock pattern? <sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="it-causes-memory-unsafety">It causes memory unsafety</h2>

<p>This issue is specific to Rust, and I promise that this will be the only Rust-specific answer.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/enums.html">Rust enums</a> provide a form of algebraic data types. A Rust enum is allowed to “contain” data,
for example you can have the enum</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">StringOrInt</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nf">Int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">i64</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which gives us a type that can either be a variant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Str</code>, with an associated string, or a variant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Int</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, with an associated integer.</p>

<p>With such an enum, we could cause a segfault like so:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hi!"</span><span class="nf">.to_string</span><span class="p">());</span> <span class="c1">// Create an instance of the `Str` variant with associated string "Hi!"</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Create a mutable alias to x</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nf">Str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">ref</span> <span class="n">insides</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// If x is a `Str`, assign its inner data to the variable `insides`</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Set `*y` to `Int(1), therefore setting `x` to `Int(1)` too</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"x says: {}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">insides</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Uh oh!</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we invalidated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insides</code> reference because setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Int(1)</code> meant that there is no longer a string inside it.
However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insides</code> is still a reference to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>, and the generated assembly would try to dereference the memory location where
the pointer to the allocated string <em>was</em>, and probably end up trying to dereference <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> or some nearby data instead, and cause a segfault.</p>

<p>Okay, so far so good. We know that for Rust-style enums to work safely in Rust, we need the RWLock pattern. But are there any other
reasons we need the RWLock pattern? Not many languages have such enums, so this shouldn’t really be a problem for them.</p>

<h2 id="iterator-invalidation">Iterator invalidation</h2>

<p>Ah, the example that is brought up almost every time the question above is asked. While I’ve been quite guilty of
using this example often myself (and feel that it is a very appropriate example that can be quickly explained),
I also find it to be a bit of a cop-out, for reasons which I will explain below. This is partly why I’m writing
this post in the first place; a better idea of the answer to The Question should be available for those who want
to dig deeper.</p>

<p>Iterator invalidation involves using tools like iterators whilst modifying the underlying dataset somehow.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">buf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">buf</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">buf</span><span class="nf">.push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Firstly, this will loop infinitely (if it compiled, which it doesn’t, because Rust prevents this). The
equivalent C++ example would be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5638323/modifying-a-data-structure-while-iterating-over-it">this one</a>, which I <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/Presentations/Rust/#/1/2">use</a> at every opportunity.</p>

<p>What’s happening in both code snippets is that the iterator is really just a pointer to the vector and an index.
It doesn’t contain a snapshot of the original vector; so pushing to the original vector will make the iterator iterate for
longer. Pushing once per iteration will obviously make it iterate forever.</p>

<p>The infinite loop isn’t even the real problem here. The real problem is that after a while, we could get a segmentation fault.
Internally, vectors have a certain amount of allocated space to work with. If the vector is grown past this space,
a new, larger allocation may need to be done (freeing the old one), since vectors must use contiguous memory.</p>

<p>This means that when the vector overflows its capacity, it will reallocate, invalidating the reference stored in the
iterator, and causing use-after-free.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a trivial solution in this case — store a reference to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector</code> object inside
the iterator instead of just the pointer to the vector on the heap. This leads to some extra indirection or a larger
stack size for the iterator (depending on how you implement it), but overall will prevent the memory unsafety.</p>

<p>This would still cause problems with more complex situations involving multidimensional vectors, however.</p>

<h2 id="its-effectively-threaded">“It’s effectively threaded”</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aliasing with mutability in a sufficiently complex, single-threaded program is effectively the same thing as
accessing data shared across multiple threads without a lock</p>
</blockquote>

<s>(The above is my paraphrasing of someone else's quote; but I can't find the original or remember who made it)</s>

<p>Edit (Jan 2017): I found the original, it’s a comment by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2x0h17/whats_your_killer_rust_feature/cow3zod/">kmc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My intuition is that code far away from my code <em>might as well be in another thread</em>,
for all I can reason about what it will do to shared mutable state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s step back a bit and figure out why we need locks in multithreaded programs. The way caches and memory work;
we’ll never need to worry about two processes writing to the same memory location simultaneously and coming up with
a hybrid value, or a read happening halfway through a write.</p>

<p>What we do need to worry about is the rug being pulled out underneath our feet. A bunch of related reads/writes
would have been written with some invariants in mind, and arbitrary reads/writes possibly happening between them
would invalidate those invariants. For example, a bit of code might first read the length of a vector, and then go ahead
and iterate through it with a regular for loop bounded on the length.
The invariant assumed here is the length of the vector. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pop()</code> was called on the vector in some other thread, this invariant could be
invalidated after the read to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">length</code> but before the reads elsewhere, possibly causing a segfault or use-after-free in the last iteration.</p>

<p>However, we can have a situation similar to this (in spirit) in single threaded code. Consider the following:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">some_big_thing</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="py">.some_vec</span><span class="nf">.len</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="n">len</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span><span class="nf">.do_something_complicated</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="py">.some_vec</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have the same invariant here; but can we be sure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.do_something_complicated()</code> doesn’t modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.some_vec</code> for
some reason? In a complicated codebase, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do_something_complicated()</code> itself calls a lot of other functions which may
also modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>, this can be hard to audit.</p>

<p>Of course, the above example is a simplification and contrived; but it doesn’t seem unreasonable to assume that such
bugs can happen in large codebases — where many methods being called have side effects which may not always be evident.</p>

<p>Which means that in large codebases we have almost the same problem as threaded ones. It’s very hard to maintain invariants
when one is not completely sure of what each line of code is doing. It’s possible to become sure of this by reading through the code
(which takes a while), but further modifications may also have to do the same. It’s impractical to do this all the time and eventually
bugs will start cropping up.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having a static guarantee that this can’t happen is great. And when the code is too convoluted for
a static guarantee (or you just want to avoid the borrow checker), a single-threaded RWlock-esque type called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a>
is available in Rust. It’s a type providing interior mutability and behaves like a runtime version of the borrow checker.
Similar wrappers can be written in other languages.</p>

<p>Edit: In case of many primitives like simple integers, the problems with shared mutability turn out to not be a major issue.
For these, we have a type called <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cell/struct.Cell.html">Cell</a> which lets these be mutated and shared simultaenously. This works on all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy</code>
types; i.e. types which only need to be copied on the stack to be copied. (Unlike types involving pointers or other indirection)</p>

<p>This sort of bug is a good source of reentrancy problems too.</p>

<h2 id="safe-abstractions">Safe abstractions</h2>

<p>In particular, the issue in the previous section makes it hard to write safe abstractions, especially with generic code.
While this problem is clearer in the case of Rust (where abstractions are expected to be safe and preferably low-cost),
this isn’t unique to any language.</p>

<p>Every method you expose has a contract that is expected to be followed. Many times, a contract is handled by type safety itself,
or you may have some error-based model to throw out uncontractual data (for example, division by zero).</p>

<p>But, as an API (can be either internal or exposed) gets more complicated, so does the contract. It’s not always possible to verify that the contract is being violated
at runtime either, for example many cases of iterator invalidation are hard to prevent in nontrivial code even with asserts.</p>

<p>It’s easy to create a method and add documentation “the first two arguments should not point to the same memory”.
But if this method is used by other methods, the contract can change to much more complicated things that are harder to express
or check. When generics get involved, it only gets worse; you sometimes have no way of forcing that there are no shared mutable aliases,
or of expressing what isn’t allowed in the documentation. Nor will it be easy for an API consumer to enforce this.</p>

<p>This makes it harder and harder to write safe, generic abstractions. Such abstractions rely on invariants, and these invariants can often
be broken by the problems in the previous section. It’s not always easy to enforce these invariants, and such abstractions will either
be misused or not written in the first place, opting for a heavier option. Generally one sees that such abstractions or patterns are avoided
altogether, even though they may provide a performance boost, because they are risky and hard to maintain. Even if the present version of
the code is correct, someone may change something in the future breaking the invariants again.</p>

<p><a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/">My previous post</a> outlines a situation where Rust was able to choose
the lighter path in a situation where getting the same guarantees would be hard in C++.</p>

<p>Note that this is a wider problem than just with mutable aliasing. Rust has this problem too, but not when it comes to mutable aliasing.
Mutable aliasing is important to fix however, because we can make a lot of assumptions about our program when there are no mutable aliases.
Namely, by looking at a line of code we can know what happened wrt the locals. If there is the possibility of mutable aliasing out there; there’s the
possibility that other locals were modified too. A very simple example is:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">look_ma_no_temp_var_l33t_interview_swap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>In both cases, when the two references are the same<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, instead of swapping, the two variables get set to zero.
A user (internal to your library, or an API consumer) would expect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> to not change anything when fed equal
references, but this is doing something totally different. This assumption could get used in a program; for example instead
of skipping the passes in an array sort where the slot is being compared with itself, one might just go ahead with it
because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> won’t change anything there anyway; but it does, and suddenly your sort function fills everything with
zeroes. This could be solved by documenting the precondition and using asserts, but the documentation gets harder and harder
as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> is used in the guts of other methods.</p>

<p>Of course, the example above was contrived. It’s well known that those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> implementations have that precondition,
and shouldn’t be used in such cases. Also, in most swap algorithms it’s trivial to ignore cases when you’re comparing
an element with itself, generally done by bounds checking.</p>

<p>But the example is a simplified sketch of the problem at hand.</p>

<p>In Rust, since this is statically checked, one doesn’t worry much about these problems, and
robust APIs can be designed since knowing when something won’t be mutated can help simplify
invariants.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Aliasing that doesn’t fit the RWLock pattern is dangerous. If you’re using a language like
Rust, you don’t need to worry. If you’re using a language like C++, it can cause memory unsafety,
so be very careful. If you’re using a language like Java or Go, while it can’t cause memory unsafety,
it will cause problems in complex bits of code.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that this problem should force you to switch to Rust, either. If you feel that you
can avoid writing APIs where this happens, that is a valid way to go around it. This problem is much
rarer in languages with a GC, so you might be able to avoid it altogether without much effort. It’s
also okay to use runtime checks and asserts to maintain your invariants; performance isn’t everything.</p>

<p>But this <em>is</em> an issue in programming; and make sure you think of it when designing your code.</p>
