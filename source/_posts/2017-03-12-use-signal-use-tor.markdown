I went to send a missive today<br>
As I have done so oft before<br>
But I forgot to employ that scrap of advice<br>
"Use Signal. Use Tor."



Intercepted of course the missive was<br>
By a ferocious beast of lore<br>
Because I failed to use that bit of advice<br>
"Use Signal. Use Tor."



The beast was strong; and formidable<br>
He hated the amendments four<br>
I should have remembered that piece of advice<br>
"Use Signal. Use Tor."


I tried to reason with the beast<br>
but he only wanted war<br>
Do not neglect that important advice<br>
"Use Signal. Use Tor."




Here I lie in the belly of the beast<br>
I shall discount this advice no more<br>
If I ever manage to leave this place<br>
I'll use Signal, and Tor.




Heed this advice, children.<br>
It's not something to ignore<br>
Always, always, always, always<br>
Use Signal. Use Tor.
