<div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been thinking about garbage collection in Rust for a long time, ever since I started working on <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a>’s JS layer. I’ve <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/designing-a-gc-in-rust/">designed a GC library</a>, <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/08/18/gc-support-in-rust-api-design/">worked on GC integration ideas for Rust itself</a>, worked on Servo’s JS GC integration, and helped out with a <a href="https://github.com/asajeffrey/josephine">couple</a> <a href="https://github.com/kyren/gc-arena">other</a> GC projects in Rust.</p>

<p>As a result, I tend to get pulled into GC discussions fairly often. I enjoy talking about GCs – don’t get me wrong – but I often end up going over the same stuff. Being <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/08/26/why-i-enjoy-blogging/#blogging-lets-me-be-lazy">lazy</a> I’d much prefer to be able to refer people to a single place where they can get up to speed on the general space of GC design, after which it’s possible to have more in depth discussions about the specific tradeoffs necessary.</p>

<p>I’ll note that some of the GCs in this post are experiments or unmaintained. The goal of this post is to showcase these as examples of <em>design</em>, not necessarily general-purpose crates you may wish to use, though some of them are usable crates as well.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-terminology">A note on terminology</h3>

<p>A thing that often muddles discussions about GCs is that according to some definition of “GC”, simple reference counting <em>is</em> a GC. Typically the definition of GC used in academia broadly refers to any kind of automatic memory management. However, most programmers familiar with the term “GC” will usually liken it to “what Java, Go, Haskell, and C# do”, which can be unambiguously referred to as <em>tracing</em> garbage collection.</p>

<p>Tracing garbage collection is the kind which keeps track of which heap objects are directly reachable (“roots”), figures out the whole set of reachable heap objects (“tracing”, also, “marking”), and then cleans them up (“sweeping”).</p>

<p>Throughout this blog post I will use the term “GC” to refer to tracing garbage collection/collectors unless otherwise stated<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="why-write-gcs-for-rust">Why write GCs for Rust?</h2>

<p>(If you already want to write a GC in Rust and are reading this post to get ideas for <em>how</em>, you can skip this section. You already know why someone would want to write a GC for Rust)</p>

<p>Every time this topic is brought up someone will inevitably go “I thought the point of Rust was to avoid GCs” or “GCs will ruin Rust” or something. As a general rule it’s good to not give too much weight to the comments section, but I think it’s useful to explain why someone may wish for GC-like semantics in Rust.</p>

<p>There are really two distinct kinds of use cases. Firstly, sometimes you need to manage memory with cycles and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is inadequate for the job since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>-cycles get leaked. <a href="https://docs.rs/petgraph/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">petgraph</code></a> or an <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2021/03/15/arenas-in-rust/">arena</a> are often acceptable solutions for this kind of pattern, but not always, especially if your data is super heterogeneous. This kind of thing crops up often when dealing with concurrent datastructures; for example <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crossbeam</code></a> has <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.8.0/crossbeam/epoch/index.html">an epoch-based memory management system</a> which, while not a full tracing GC, has a lot of characteristics in common with GCs.</p>

<p>For the first use case it’s rarely necessary to design a custom GC, you can look for a reusable crate like <a href="https://docs.rs/gc/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc</code></a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The second case is far more interesting in my experience, and since it cannot be solved by off-the-shelf solutions tends to crop up more often: integration with (or implementation of) programming languages that <em>do</em> use a garbage collector. <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> needs to do this for integrating with the Spidermonkey JS engine and <a href="https://github.com/kyren/luster">luster</a> needed to do this for implementing the GC of its Lua VM. <a href="https://github.com/jasonwilliams/boa/">boa</a>, a pure Rust JS runtime, uses the <a href="https://docs.rs/gc/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc</code></a> crate to back its garbage collector.</p>

<p>Sometimes when integrating with a GCd language you can get away with not needing to implement a full garbage collector: JNI does this; while C++ does not have native garbage collection, JNI gets around this by simply rooting anything that crosses over to the C++ side<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. This is often fine!</p>

<p>The downside of this is that every interaction with objects managed by the GC has to go through an API call; you can’t “embed” efficient Rust/C++ objects in the GC with ease. For example, in browsers most DOM types (e.g. <a href="https://doc.servo.org/script/dom/element/struct.Element.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Element</code></a>) are implemented in native code; and need to be able to contain references to other native GC’d types (it should be possible to inspect the <a href="https://doc.servo.org/script/dom/node/struct.Node.html#structfield.child_list">children of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node</code></a> without needing to call back into the JavaScript engine).</p>

<p>So sometimes you need to be able to integrate with a GC from a runtime; or even implement your own GC if you are writing a runtime that needs one. In both of these cases you typically want to be able to safely manipulate GC’d objects from Rust code, and even directly put Rust types on the GC heap.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-gcs-in-rust-hard">Why are GCs in Rust hard?</h2>

<p>In one word: Rooting. In a garbage collector, the objects “directly” in use on the stack are the “roots”, and you need to be able to identify them. Here, when I say “directly”, I mean “accessible without having to go through other GC’d objects”, so putting an object inside a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> does not make it stop being a root, but putting it inside some other GC’d object does.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Rust doesn’t really have a concept of “directly on the stack”:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Option</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Bar</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">// this is a root</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Bar</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="c">// this is also a root</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="c">// bar should no longer be a root (but we can't detect that!)</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="py">.bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c">// but foo should still be a root here since it's not inside</span>
<span class="c">// another GC'd object</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust’s ownership system actually makes it easier to have fewer roots since it’s relatively easy to state that taking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> of a GC’d object doesn’t need to create a new root, and let Rust’s ownership system sort it out, but being able to distinguish between “directly owned” and “indirectly owned” is super tricky.</p>

<p>Another aspect of this is that garbage collection is really a moment of global mutation – the garbage collector reads through the heap and then deletes some of the objects there. This is a moment of the rug being pulled out under your feet. Rust’s entire design is predicated on such rug-pulling being <em>very very bad and not to be allowed</em>, so this can be a bit problematic. This isn’t as bad as it may initially sound because after all the rug-pulling is mostly just cleaning up unreachable objects, but it does crop up a couple times when fitting things together, especially around destructors and finalizers<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Rooting would be far easier if, for example, you were able to declare areas of code where “no GC can happen”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">5</a></sup> so you can tightly scope the rug-pulling and have to worry less about roots.</p>

<h2 id="how-would-you-even-garbage-collect-without-a-runtime">How would you even garbage collect without a runtime?</h2>

<p>In most garbage collected languages, there’s a runtime that controls all execution, knows about every variable in the program, and is able to pause execution to run the GC whenever it likes.</p>

<p>Rust has a minimal runtime and can’t do anything like this, especially not in a pluggable way your library can hook in to. For thread local GCs you basically have to write it such that GC operations (things like mutating a GC field; basically some subset of the APIs exposed by your GC library) are the only things that may trigger the garbage collector.</p>

<p>Concurrent GCs can trigger the GC on a separate thread but will typically need to pause other threads whenever these threads attempt to perform a GC operation that could potentially be invalidated by the running garbage collector.</p>

<p>While this may restrict the flexibility of the garbage collector itself, this is actually pretty good for us from the side of API design: the garbage collection phase can only happen in certain well-known moments of the code, which means we only need to make things safe across <em>those</em> boundaries. Many of the designs we shall look at build off of this observation.</p>

<h2 id="tracing">Tracing</h2>

<p>Before getting into the actual examples of GC design, I want to point out a commonality of design between all of them: how they do tracing.</p>

<p>“Tracing” is the operation of traversing the graph of GC objects, starting from your roots and perusing their children, and their children’s children, and so on.</p>

<p>In Rust, the easiest way to implement this is via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#how-to-write-a-custom-derive-macro">custom derive</a>:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// unsafe to implement by hand since you can get it wrong</span>
<span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="k">trait</span> <span class="n">Trace</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">trace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">gc_context</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">GcContext</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">vec</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Bar</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">extra_thing</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Baz</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">just_a_string</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The custom derive of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> basically just calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code> on all the fields. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> implementation will be written to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code> on all of its fields, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> implementation will do nothing. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> will likely have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code> that marks its reachability in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcContext</code>, or something similar.</p>

<p>This is a pretty standard pattern, and while the specifics of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait will typically vary, the general idea is roughly the same.</p>

<p>I’m not going to get into the actual details of how mark-and-sweep algorithms work in this post; there are a lot of potential designs for them and they’re not that interesting from the point of view of designing a safe GC <em>API</em> in Rust. However, the general idea is to keep a queue of found objects initially populated by the root, trace them to find new objects and queue them up if they’ve not already been traced. Clean up any objects that were <em>not</em> found.</p>

<h2 id="rust-gc">rust-gc</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/gc/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc</code></a> crate is one I wrote with <a href="https://twitter.com/kneecaw/">Nika Layzell</a> mostly as a fun exercise, to figure out if a safe GC API is <em>possible</em>. I’ve <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/designing-a-gc-in-rust/">written about the design in depth before</a>, but the essence of the design is that it does something similar to reference counting to keep track of roots, and forces all GC mutations go through special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcCell</code> types so that they can update the root count:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">GcCell</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Option</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Bar</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">// this is a root</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Bar</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="c">// this is also a root</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Foo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="c">// .borrow_mut()'s RAII guard unroots bar</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="py">.bar</span><span class="nf">.borrow_mut</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c">// foo is still a root here, no call to .set()</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While this is essentially “free” on reads, this is a fair amount of reference count traffic on any kind of write, which might not be desired. Part of the goal of using GCs is to <em>avoid</em> reference-counting-like patterns.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/gc/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc</code></a> is useful as a general-purpose GC if you just want a couple of things to participate in cycles without having to think about it too much. The general design can apply to a specialized GC integrating with another language runtime since it provides a clear way to keep track of roots; but it may not necessarily have the desired performance characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="servos-dom-integration">Servo’s DOM integration</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> is a browser engine in Rust that I used to work on full time. As mentioned earlier, browser engines typically implement a lot of their DOM types in native (i.e. Rust or C++, not JS) code, so for example <a href="https://doc.servo.org/script/dom/element/struct.Element.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node</code></a> is a pure Rust object, and it <a href="https://doc.servo.org/script/dom/node/struct.Node.html#structfield.child_list">contains direct references to its children</a> so Rust code can do things like traverse the tree without having to go back and forth between JS and Rust.</p>

<p>Servo’s model is a little weird: roots are a <em>different type</em>, and lints enforce that unrooted heap references are never placed on the stack:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[dom_struct]</span> <span class="c">// this is #[derive(JSTraceable)] plus some markers for lints</span>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dom&lt;T&gt;</code> is basically a smart pointer that behaves like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> but without a lifetime, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DomRoot&lt;T&gt;</code> has the additional behavior of rooting on creation (and unrooting on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code>). The custom lint plugin essentially enforces that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dom&lt;T&gt;</code>, and any DOM structs (tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[dom_struct]</code>) are never accessible on the stack aside from through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DomRoot&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code>.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t recommend this approach; it works okay but we’ve wanted to move off of it for a while. But it’s worth mentioning for completeness.</p>

<h2 id="josephine-servos-experimental-gc-plans">Josephine (Servo’s experimental GC plans)</h2>

<p>Given that Servo’s existing GC solution depends on plugging in to the compiler to do additional static analysis, we wanted something better. So <a href="https://github.com/asajeffrey/">Alan</a> designed <a href="https://github.com/asajeffrey/josephine">Josephine</a> (“JS affine”), which uses Rust’s affine types and borrowing in a cleaner way to provide a safe GC system.</p>

<p>Josephine is explicitly designed for Servo’s use case and as such does a lot of neat things around “compartments” and such that are probably irrelevant unless you specifically wish for your GC to integrate with a JS engine.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the fact that the garbage collection phase can only happen in certain well-known moments of the code actually can make things easier for GC design, and Josephine is an example of this.</p>

<p>Josephine has a “JS context”, which is to be passed around everywhere and essentially represents the GC itself. When doing operations which may trigger a GC, you have to borrow the context mutably, whereas when accessing heap objects you need to borrow the context immutably. You can root heap objects to remove this requirement:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new_root()</code> creates a new root, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in_root</code> ties the lifetime of a JS managed type to the root instead of to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSContext</code> borrow, releasing the borrow of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSContext</code> and allowing it to be borrowed mutably in future <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.borrow_mut()</code> calls.</p>

<p>Essentially, when mutating a field, you have to obtain mutable access to the context, so there will not be any references to the field itself still around (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element.borrow(cx).parent</code>), only to the GC’d data within it, so you can change what a field references without invalidating other references to the <em>contents</em> of what the field references. This is a pretty cool trick that enables GC <em>without runtime-checked interior mutability</em>, which is relatively rare in such designs.</p>

<h2 id="unfinished-design-for-a-builtin-rust-gc">Unfinished design for a builtin Rust GC</h2>

<p>For a while a couple of us worked on a way to make Rust <em>itself</em> extensible with a pluggable GC, using LLVM stack map support for finding roots. After all, if we know which types are GC-ish, we can include metadata on how to find roots for each function, similar to how Rust functions currently contain unwinding hooks to enable cleanly running destructors during a panic.</p>

<p>We never got around to figuring out a <em>complete</em> design, but you can find more information on what we figured out in <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/08/18/gc-support-in-rust-api-design/">my</a> and <a href="http://blog.pnkfx.org/blog/categories/gc/">Felix’s</a> posts on this subject. Essentially, it involved a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait with more generic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace</code> methods, an auto-implemented <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> trait that works similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code>, and compiler machinery to keep track of which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> types are on the stack.</p>

<p>This is probably not too useful for people attempting to implement a GC, but I’m mentioning it for completeness’ sake.</p>

<p>Note that pre-1.0 Rust did have a builtin GC (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@T</code>, known as “managed pointers”), but IIRC in practice the cycle-management parts were not ever implemented so it behaved exactly like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>. I believe it was intended to have a cycle collector (I’ll talk more about that in the next section).</p>

<h2 id="bacon-rajan-cc-and-cycle-collectors-in-general">bacon-rajan-cc (and cycle collectors in general)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fitzgen">Nick Fitzgerald</a> wrote <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/bacon-rajan-cc"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bacon-rajan-cc</code></a> to implement _<a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon01Concurrent.pdf">“Concurrent Cycle Collection in Reference Counted Systems”</a>__ by David F. Bacon and V.T. Rajan.</p>

<p>This is what is colloquially called a <em>cycle collector</em>; a kind of garbage collector which is essentially “what if we took <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> but made it detect cycles”. These are not typically considered to be <em>tracing</em> garbage collectors, but they have a lot of similar characteristics.</p>

<p>The idea is that you don’t actually need to <em>know</em> what the roots are if you’re maintaining reference counts: if a heap object has a reference count that is more than the number of heap objects referencing it, it must be a root. In practice it’s pretty inefficient to traverse the entire heap, so optimizations are applied, often by applying different “colors” to nodes, and by only looking at the set of objects that have recently have their reference counts decremented.</p>

<p>A crucial observation here is that if you <em>only focus on potential garbage</em>, you can shift your definition of “root” a bit, when looking for cycles you don’t need to look for references from the stack, you can be satisfied with references from <em>any part of the heap you know for a fact is reachable from things which are not potential garbage</em>.</p>

<p>A neat property of cycle collectors is while mark and sweep tracing GCs have their performance scale by the size of the heap as a whole, cycle collectors scale by the size of <em>the actual garbage you have</em> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. There are of course other tradeoffs:  deallocation is often cheaper or “free” in tracing GCs (amortizing those costs by doing it during the sweep phase) whereas cycle collectors have the constant allocator traffic involved in cleaning up objects when refcounts reach zero.</p>

<p>The way <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/bacon-rajan-cc">bacon-rajan-cc</a> works is that every time a reference count is decremented, the object is added to a list of “potential cycle roots”, unless the reference count is decremented to 0 (in which case the object is immediately cleaned up, just like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>). It then traces through this list; decrementing refcounts for every reference it follows, and cleaning up any elements that reach refcount 0. It then traverses this list <em>again</em> and reincrements refcounts for each reference it follows, to restore the original refcount. This basically treates any element not reachable from this “potential cycle root” list as “not garbage”, and doesn’t bother to visit it.</p>

<p>Cycle collectors require tighter control over the garbage collection algorithm, and have differing performance characteristics, so they may not necessarily be suitable for all use cases for GC integration in Rust, but it’s definitely worth considering!</p>

<p>All mutation goes through autogenerated accessors, so the crate has a little more control over traffic through the GC.</p>

<s>Garbage collection typically happens after a heap session is over, you can pin types across heap sessions using `FrozenGcRef<T>`, which provides a separate refcounted root type.&lt;/s&gt;

Heap sessions allow for the heap to moved around, even sent to other threads, and their lifetime prevents heap objects from being mixed between sessions (TBD is this generativity?).

TBD explain how the GC works here.

## Interlude: The similarities between `async` and GCs

The next two examples use machinery from Rust's `async` functionality despite having nothing to do with async I/O, and I think it's important to talk about why that should make sense. I've [tweeted about this before][manish-async-tweet]: I and [Catherine West][kyren] figured this out when we were talking about [her GC idea][gc-arena] based on `async`.

You can see some of this correspondence in Go: Go is a language that has both garbage collection and async I/O, and both of these use the same "safepoints" for yielding to the garbage collector or the scheduler. In Go, the compiler needs to automatically insert code that checks the "pulse" of the heap every now and then, and potentially runs garbage collection. It also needs to automatically insert code that can tell the scheduler "hey now is a safe time to interrupt me if a different goroutine wishes to run". These are very similar in principle -- they're both essentially places where the compiler is inserting "it is okay to interrupt me now" checks, sometimes called "interruption points" or "yield points".

Now, Rust's compiler does not automatically insert interruption points. However, the design of `async` in Rust is essentially a way of adding _explicit_ interruption points to Rust. `foo().await` in Rust is a way of running `foo()` and expecting that the scheduler _may_ interrupt the code in between. The design of [`Future`][future] and [`Pin<p>`][pin-p] come out of making this safe and pleasant to work with.

As we shall see, this same machinery can be used for creating safe interruption points for GCs in Rust.

## Shifgrethor

[shifgrethor] is an experiment by [Saoirse][withoutboats] to try and build a GC that uses [`Pin<p>`][pin-p] for managing roots. They've written extensively on the design of [shifgrethor][shifgrethor] [on their blog][shif-blog]. In particular, the [post on rooting][shif-root] goes through how rooting works.

The basic design is that there's a `Root&lt;'root&gt;` type that contains a `Pin<p>`, which can be _immovably_ tied to a stack frame using the same idea behind `pin-utils`' [`pin_mut!()` macro][pin-mut]:

```rust
letroot!(root);
let gc: Gc&lt;'root, Foo&gt; = root.gc(Foo::new());
```

The fact that `root` is immovable allows for it to be treated as a true marker for the _stack frame_ over anything else. The list of rooted types can be neatly stored in an ordered stack-like vector in the GC implementation, popping when individual roots go out of scope.

If you wish to return a rooted object from a function, the function needs to accept a `Root&lt;'root&gt;`:

```rust
fn new&lt;'root&gt;(root: Root&lt;'root&gt;) -&gt; Gc&lt;'root, Self&gt; {
    root.gc(Self {
        // ...
    }
}
```

All GC'd types have a `'root` lifetime of the root they trace back to, and are declared with a custom derive:

```rust
#[derive(GC)]
struct Foo&lt;'root&gt; {
    #[gc] bar: GcStore&lt;'root, Bar&gt;,
}
```

`GcStore` is a way to have fields use the rooting of their parent. Normally, if you wanted to put `Gc&lt;'root2, Bar&lt;'root2&gt;&gt;` inside `Foo&lt;'root1&gt;` you would not be able to because the lifetimes derive from different roots. `GcStore`, along with autogenerated accessors from `#[derive(GC)]`, will set `Bar`'s lifetime to be the same as `Foo` when you attempt to stick it inside `Foo`.


This design is somewhat similar to that of Servo where there's a pair of types, one that lets us refer to GC types on the stack, and one that lets GC types refer to each other on the heap, but it uses `Pin<p>` instead of a lint to enforce this safely, which is way nicer. `Root&lt;'root&gt;` and `GcStore` do a bunch of lifetime tweaking that's reminiscent of Josephine's rooting system, however there's no need for an `&amp;mut JsContext` type that needs to be passed around everywhere.

## gc-arena

[`gc-arena`][gc-arena] is [Catherine West][kyren]'s experimental GC design for her Lua VM, [`luster`][luster].

The `gc-arena` crate forces all GC-manipulating code to go within `arena.mutate()` calls, between which garbage collection may occur.

#[derive(Collect)]
#[collect(no_drop)]
struct TestRoot&lt;'gc&gt; {
    number: Gc&lt;'gc, i32&gt;,
    many_numbers: GcCell&lt;Vec&lt;Gc&lt;'gc, i32&gt;&gt;&gt;,
}

make_arena!(TestArena, TestRoot);

let mut arena = TestArena::new(ArenaParameters::default(), |mc| TestRoot {
    number: Gc::allocate(mc, 42),
    many_numbers: GcCell::allocate(mc, Vec::new()),
});

arena.mutate(|_mc, root| {
    assert_eq!(*((*root).number), 42);
    root.numbers.write(mc).push(Gc::allocate(mc, 0));
});
```

Mutation is done with `GcCell`, basically a fancier version of `Gc&lt;RefCell<T>&gt;`. All GC operations require a `MutationContext` (`mc`), which is only available within `arena.mutate()`. This crate allows for multiple GCs to operate simultaneously, and it enforces that GC types do not mix by using _generativity_ (you can read more about generativity in _["You Can't Spell Trust Without Rust"][thesis] ch 6.3, by [Alexis Beingessner][gankra], or by looking at the [`indexing`] crate).

Only the arena root may survive between `mutate()` calls, and garbage collection does not happen during `.mutate()`, so rooting is easy -- just follow the arena root.

So far this is mostly like other arena-based systems, with a GC.

The _really cool_ part of the design is the `gc-sequence` crate, which essentially builds a `Future`-like API (using a `Sequence` trait) on top of `gc-arena` that can potentially make this very pleasant to use. Here's a modified example from a test:

```rust
#[derive(Collect)]
#[collect(no_drop)]
struct TestRoot&lt;'gc&gt; {
    test: Gc&lt;'gc, i32&gt;,
}

make_sequencable_arena!(test_sequencer, TestRoot);
use test_sequencer::Arena as TestArena;

let arena = TestArena::new(ArenaParameters::default(), |mc| TestRoot {
    test: Gc::allocate(mc, 42),
});

let mut sequence = arena.sequence(|root| {
    sequence::from_fn_with(root.test, |_, test| {
        if *test == 42 {
            Ok(*test + 10)
        } else {
            Err("will not be generated")
        }
    })
    .and_then(|_, r| Ok(r + 12))
    .and_chain(|_, r| Ok(sequence::ok(r - 10)))
    .then(|_, res| res.expect("should not be error"))
    .chain(|_, r| sequence::done(r + 10))
    .map(|r| sequence::done(r - 60))
    .flatten()
    .boxed()
});

loop {
    match sequence.step() {
        Ok((_, output)) =&gt; {
            assert_eq!(output, 4);
            return;
        }
        Err(s) =&gt; sequence = s,
    }
}
```

This is _very_ similar to chained callback futures code; and if it could use the `Future` trait would be able to make use of `async` to convert this callback heavy code into sequential code with interrupt points using `await`. There were design constraints making `Future` not workable for this use case, though if Rust ever gets generators this would work well, and it's quite possible that another GC with a similar design could be written, using `async`/`await` and `Future`.

Essentially, this paints a picture of an entire space of Rust GC design where GC mutations are performed using `await` (or `yield` if we ever get generators), and garbage collection can occur during those yield points, in a way that's highly reminiscent of Go's design.

## Your design here?

As is hopefully obvious, the space of safe GC design in Rust is quite rich and has a lot of interesting ideas. I'm really excited to see what folks come up with here!

TBD: expand this section, maybe reframe

      <p>I’m also going to completely ignore the field of <em>conservative</em> stack-scanning tracing GCs where you figure out your roots by looking at all the stack memory and considering anything with a remotely heap-object-like bit pattern to be a root. These are interesting, but can’t really be made 100% safe in the way Rust wants them to be unless you scan the heap as well. <a href="#fnref:0" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Firefox’s DOM actually uses a mark &amp; sweep tracing GC <em>mixed with</em> a cycle collector for this reason. The DOM types themselves are cycle collected, but JavaScript objects are managed by the Spidermonkey GC. Since some DOM types may contain references to arbitrary JS types (e.g. ones that store callbacks) there’s a fair amount of work required to break cycles manually in some cases, but it has performance benefits since the vast majority of DOM objects either never become garbage or become garbage by having a couple non-cycle-participating references get released. <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
