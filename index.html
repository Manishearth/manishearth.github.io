  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17015654/apple-iphone-crash-ios-11-bug-imessage">yet another iOS text crash</a>, where just looking at a particular string crashes
iOS. Basically, if you put this string in any system text box (and other places), it crashes that
process. I&rsquo;ve been testing it by copy-pasting characters into Spotlight so I don&rsquo;t end up crashing
my browser.</p>

<p>The original sequence is U+0C1C U+0C4D U+0C1E U+200C U+0C3E, which is a sequence of Telugu
characters: the consonant ja (జ), a virama (్), the consonant nya (ఞ), a zero-width non-joiner, and
the vowel aa (ా).</p>

<p>I was pretty interested in what made this sequence &ldquo;special&rdquo;, and started investigating.</p>

<p>So first when looking into this, I thought that the &lt;ja, virama, nya&gt; sequence was the culprit.
That sequence forms a special ligature in many Indic scripts (ज्ञ in Devanagari) which is often
considered a letter of its own. However, the ligature for Telugu doesn&rsquo;t seem very &ldquo;special&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Also, from some experimentation, this bug seemed to occur for <em>any</em> pair of Telugu consonants with
a vowel, as long as the vowel is not ై (ai). Huh.</p>

<p>The ZWNJ must be doing something weird, then. &lt;consonant, virama, consonant, vowel&gt; is a
pretty common sequence in any Indic script; but ZWNJ before a vowel isn&rsquo;t very useful for most
scripts (except for Bengali and Oriya, but I&rsquo;ll get to that).</p>

<p>And then I saw that <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeUnicode/status/963300865762254848">there was a sequence in Bengali</a> that also crashed.</p>

<p>The sequence is U+09B8 U+09CD U+09B0 U+200C U+09C1, which is the consonant &ldquo;so&rdquo; (স), a virama (্),
the consonant &ldquo;ro&rdquo; (র), a ZWNJ, and vowel u (ু).</p>

<p>Before we get too into this, let&rsquo;s first take a little detour to learn how Indic scripts work:</p>

<h2>Indic scripts and consonant clusters</h2>

<p>Indic scripts are <em>abugidas</em>; which means that their &ldquo;letters&rdquo; are consonants, which you
can attach diacritics to to change the vowel. By default, consonants have a base vowel.
So, for example, क is &ldquo;kuh&rdquo; (kə, often transcribed as &ldquo;ka&rdquo;), but I can change the vowel to make it के
(the &ldquo;ka&rdquo; in &ldquo;okay&rdquo;) का (&ldquo;kaa&rdquo;, like &ldquo;car&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Usually, the default vowel is the ə sound, though not always (in Bengali it&rsquo;s more of an o sound).</p>

<p>Because of the &ldquo;default&rdquo; vowel, you need a way to combine consonants. For example, if you wished to
write the word &ldquo;ski&rdquo;, you can&rsquo;t write it as स + की (sa + ki = &ldquo;saki&rdquo;), you must write it as स्की.
What&rsquo;s happened here is that the स got its vowel &ldquo;killed&rdquo;, and got tacked on to the की to form a
consonant cluster ligature.</p>

<p>You can <em>also</em> write this as स्&zwnj;की . That little tail you see on the स is known as a &ldquo;virama&rdquo;;
it basically means &ldquo;remove this vowel&rdquo;. Explicit viramas are sometimes used when there&rsquo;s no easy way
to form a ligature, e.g. in ङ्क because there is no simple way to ligatureify ङ into क. Some scripts
also <em>prefer</em> explicit viramas, e.g. &ldquo;ski&rdquo; in Malyalam is written as സ്കീ, where the little crescent
is the explicit virama.</p>

<p>In unicode, the virama character is always used to form a consonant cluster. So स्की was written as
&lt;स, ्, क, ी&gt;, or &lt;sa, virama, ka, i&gt;. If the font supports the cluster, it will show up
as a ligature, otherwise it will use an explicit virama.</p>

<p>For Devanagari and Bengali, <em>usually</em>, in a consonant cluster the first consonant is munged a bit and the second consonant stays intact.
There are exceptions &ndash; sometimes they&rsquo;ll form an entirely new glyph (क + ष = क्ष), and sometimes both
glyphs will change (ड + ड = ड्ड, द + म = द्म, द + ब = द्ब). Those last ones should look like this in conjunct form:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/unicode-crash/conjuncts.png" width="200"></p>

<h2>Investigating the Bengali case</h2>

<p>Now, interestingly, unlike the Telugu crash, the Bengali crash seemed to only occur when the second
consonant is র (&ldquo;ro&rdquo;). However, I can trigger it for any choice of the first consonant or vowel, except
when the vowel is ৌ (au).</p>

<p>Now, র is an interesting consonant in some Indic scripts, including Devanagari. In Devanagari,
it looks like र (&ldquo;ra&rdquo;). However, it does all kinds of things when forming a cluster. If you&rsquo;re having it
precede another consonant in a cluster, it forms a little feather-like stroke, like in र्क (rka). In Marathi,
that stroke can also look like a tusk, as in र्&zwj;क. As a suffix consonant, it can provide a little
&ldquo;extra leg&rdquo;, as in क्र (kra). For letters without a vertical stroke, like ठ (tha), it does this caret-like thing,
ठ्र (thra).</p>

<p>Basically, while most consonants retain some of their form when put inside a cluster, र does not. And
a more special thing about र is that this happens even when र is the <em>second</em> consonant in a cluster &ndash; as I mentioned
before, for most consonant clusters the second consonant stays intact. While there are exceptions, they are usually
specific to the cluster; it is only र for which this happens for all clusters.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s similar in Bengali, র as the second consonant adds a tentacle-like thing on the existing consonant. For example,
প + র (po + ro) gives প্র (pro).</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just র that does this in Bengali, the consonant &ldquo;jo&rdquo; does as well. প + য (po + jo) forms প্য (pjo),
and the য is transformed into a wavy line called a &ldquo;jophola&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So I tried it with য  &mdash; , and it turns out that the Bengali crash occurs for  য as well!
So the general Bengali case is &ltr;consonant, virama, র OR য, ZWNJ, vowel&gt;, where the vowel is not  ৌ.</p>

<h2>Suffix-joining consonants</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;re getting close, here. At least for Bengali, it occurs when the second consonant is such that it often
combines with the first consonant without modifying its form much.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the case for Telugu as well! Consonant clusters in Telugu are usually formed by preserving the
original consonant, and tacking the second consonant on below!</p>

<p>For example, the original crashy string contains the cluster జ + ఞ, which looks like జ్ఞ. The first letter isn&rsquo;t
really modified, but the second is.</p>

<p>From this, we can guess that it will also occur for Devanagari with र. Indeed it does! U+0915 U+094D U+0930 U+200C U+093E, that is,
&lt;क, ्, र, zwnj, ा&gt; (&lt; ka, virama, ra, zwnj, aa &gt;) is one such crashing sequence.</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t really the whole story, is it? For example, the crash does occur for &ldquo;kro&rdquo; + zwnj + vowel in Bengali,
and in &ldquo;kro&rdquo; (ক্র = ক + র = ko + ro) the resultant cluster involves the munging of both the prefix and suffix. But
the crash doesn&rsquo;t occur for द्ब or ड्ड. It seems to be specific to the letter, not the nature of the cluster.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, the reason is that for many fonts (presumably the ones in use), these consonants
form &ldquo;suffix joining consonants&rdquo; (a term I made up) when preceded by a virama</p>

<p>For example, the sequence virama + क gives ्क, i.e. it renders a virama with a placeholder followed by a क.</p>

<p>But, for र, virama + र renders ्र, which for me looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-ra.png" width="200"></p>

<p>In fact, this is the case for the other consonants as well. For me, ्र ্র ্য ్ఞ ్క
(Devanagari virama-ra, Bengali virama-ro, Bengali virama-jo, Telugu virama-nya, Telugu virama-ka)
all render as &ldquo;suffix joining consonants&rdquo;:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-consonant.png" width="200"></p>

<p>(This is true for all Telugu consonants, not just the ones listed).</p>

<p>Kannada <em>also</em> has &ldquo;suffix joining consonants&rdquo;, but for some reason I cannot trigger the crash with it.</p>

<h2>The ZWNJ</h2>

<p>The ZWNJ is curious. The crash doesn&rsquo;t happen without it, but as I mentioned before a ZWNJ before a vowel
doesn&rsquo;t really <em>do</em> anything for most Indic scripts. In Indic scripts, a ZWNJ can be used to explicitly force a
virama if used after the virama (I used it to write स्&zwnj;की in this post), however that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s being used here.</p>

<p>In Bengali and Oriya specifically, a ZWNJ can be used to force a different vowel form when used before a vowel
(e.g. রু vs র&zwnj;ু), however this bug seems to apply to vowels for which there is only one form, and this bug
also applies to other scripts where this isn&rsquo;t the case anyway.</p>

<h2>Generalizing</h2>

<p>So, ultimately, the full set of cases that cause the crash are:</p>

<p>Any sequence <code>&lt;consonant1, virama, consonant2, ZWNJ, vowel&gt;</code> in Devanagari, Bengali, and Telugu, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>consonant2</code> is suffix-joining &ndash; i.e. र, র, য, and all Telugu consonants</li>
<li><code>vowel</code> is not ై or ৌ</li>
</ul>


<p>This leaves some questions open:</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it apply to Kannada? Or, for that matter, Khmer, which has a similar virama-like thing called a &ldquo;coeng&rdquo;.
What&rsquo;s up with the exception vowels in Bengali and Telugu?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really have <em>one</em> guess as to what&rsquo;s going on here &ndash; I&rsquo;d love to see what people think &ndash; but my current
guess is that the &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; of the virama to the left instead of the right confuses the algorithm that handles ZWNJs after
viramas into thinking the ZWNJ applies to the virama (it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a consonant in between), and this leads to some numbers
not matching up and causing a buffer overflow or something.</p>

<p>An interesting thing is that I can cause this crash to happen more reliably in browsers by clicking on the string.</p>

<p>Additionally, <em>sometimes</em> it actually renders in spotlight for a split second before crashing; which means that either
the crash isn&rsquo;t deterministic, or it occurs in some process <em>after</em> rendering. I&rsquo;m not sure what to think of either.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if folks have further insight into this.</p>

<p><small>Yes, I could attach a debugger to the crashing process and investigate that instead, but that&rsquo;s no fun 😂</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sum types are pretty cool. Just like how a struct is basically &ldquo;This contains one of these <em>and</em> one of these&rdquo;,
a sum type is &ldquo;This contains one of these <em>or</em> one of these&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So for example, the following sum type in Rust:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">Stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">Numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">u32</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or Swift:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='swift'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>would be one where it&rsquo;s either <code>Foo::Stringy</code> (<code>Foo::stringy</code> for swift), containing a <code>String</code>,
<em>or</em> <code>Foo::Numerical</code>, containing an integer.</p>

<p>This can be pretty useful. For example, messages between threads are often of a &ldquo;this or that or that or that&rdquo;
form.</p>

<p>The nice thing is, matching (switching) on these enums is usually <em>exhaustive</em> &ndash; you must list all
the cases (or include a default arm) for your code to compile. This leads to a useful component
of type safety &ndash; if you add a message to your message passing system, you&rsquo;ll know where to update it.</p>

<p>Go doesn&rsquo;t have these. Go <em>does</em> have interfaces, which are dynamically dispatched. The drawback here
is that you do not get the exhaustiveness condition, and consumers of your library can even add further
cases. (And, of course, dynamic dispatch can be slow). You <em>can</em> get exhaustiveness in Go with <a href="https://github.com/haya14busa/gosum">external tools</a>,
but it&rsquo;s preferable to have such things in the language IMO.</p>

<p>Many years ago when I was learning Go I wrote a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2015/02/thoughts-of-rustacean-learning-go.html">blog post</a> about what I liked and disliked
as a Rustacean learning Go. Since then, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot more time with Go, and I&rsquo;ve learned to like each Go design decision that I initially
disliked, <em>except</em> for the lack of sum types. Most of my issues arose from &ldquo;trying to program Rust in Go&rdquo;,
i.e. using idioms that are natural to Rust (or other languages I&rsquo;d used previously). Once I got used to the
programming style, I realized that aside from the lack of sum types I really didn&rsquo;t find much missing
from the language. Perhaps improvements to error handling.</p>

<p>Now, my intention here isn&rsquo;t really to sell sum types. They&rsquo;re somewhat controversial for Go, and
there are good arguments on both sides. You can see one discussion on this topic <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19412">here</a>.
If I were to make a more concrete proposal I&rsquo;d probably try to motivate this in much more depth. But even
I&rsquo;m not very <em>strongly</em> of the opinion that Go needs sum types; I have a slight preference for it.</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m going to try and sketch this proposal for sum types that has been floating around my
mind for a while. I end up mentioning it often and it&rsquo;s nice to have something to link to. Overall,
I think this &ldquo;fits well&rdquo; with the existing Go language design.</p>

<h2>The proposal</h2>

<p>The essence is pretty straightforward: Extend interfaces to allow for &ldquo;closed interfaces&rdquo;. These are
interfaces that are only implemented for a small list of types.</p>

<p>Writing the <code>Foo</code> sum type above would be:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">SomeFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">OtherFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even need to have functions defined on it.</p>

<p>The interface functions can only be called if you have an interface object; they are not directly available
on variant types without explicitly casting (<code>Foo("...").SomeFunction()</code>).</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m not strongly for the <code>for</code> keyword syntax, it&rsquo;s just a suggestion. The core idea is that
you define an interface and you define the types it closes over. Somehow.)</p>

<p>A better example would be an interface for a message-passing system for Raft:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now, you use type switches for dealing with these:</p>

<p>There is no need for the default case, unless you wish to leave one or more of the cases out.</p>

<p>Ideally, these could be implemented as inline structs instead of using dynamic dispatch. I&rsquo;m not sure
what this entails for the GC design, but I&rsquo;d love to hear thoughts on this.</p>

<p>We also make it possible to add methods to closed interfaces. This is in the spirit of
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16254">this proposal</a>, where you allow</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>for closed interfaces.</p>

<p>This aligns more with how sum types are written and used in other languages; instead of assuming
that each method will be a <code>switch</code> on the variant, you can write arbitrary code that <em>may</em> <code>switch</code>
on the type but it can also just call other methods. This is really nice because you can write
methods in <em>both</em> ways &ndash; if it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;responsibility of the inner type&rdquo; kind of method, require it in
the interface and delegate it to the individual types. If it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;responsibility of the interface&rdquo;
method, write it as a method on the interface as a whole. I kind of wish Rust had this, because in Rust
you sometimes end up writing things like:</p>

<p>Yes, this would work better as a trait, but then you lose some niceties of Rust enums. With this
proposal Go can have it both ways.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, thoughts? This is a really rough proposal, and I&rsquo;m not sure how receptive other Gophers will be
to this, nor how complex its implementation would be. I don&rsquo;t really intend to submit this as a formal proposal,
but if someone else wants to they are more than welcome to build on this idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Rust community lately has been focusing a lot on &ldquo;async I/O&rdquo; through the <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/">tokio</a>
project. This is pretty great!</p>

<p>But for many in the community who haven&rsquo;t worked with web servers and related things it&rsquo;s pretty
confusing as to what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve there. When this stuff was being discussed around 1.0,
I was pretty lost as well, having never worked with this stuff before.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s all this Async I/O business about? What are coroutines? Lightweight threads? Futures? How
does this all fit together?</p>

<h2>What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>

<p>One of Rust&rsquo;s key features is &ldquo;fearless concurrency&rdquo;. But the kind of concurrency required for handling a
large amount of I/O bound tasks &ndash; the kind of concurrency found in Go, Elixir, Erlang &ndash; is absent
from Rust.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to build something like a web service. It&rsquo;s going to be handling thousands of
requests at any point in time (known as the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">c10k</a> problem&rdquo;). In general, the problem we&rsquo;re
considering is having a huge number of I/O bound (usually network I/O) tasks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Handling N things at once&rdquo; is best done by using threads. But &hellip; <em>thousands</em> of threads? That
sounds a bit much. Threads can be pretty expensive: Each thread needs to allocate a large stack,
setting up a thread involves a bunch of syscalls, and context switching is expensive.</p>

<p>Of course, thousands of threads <em>all doing work</em> at once is not going to work anyway. You only
have a fixed number of cores, and at any one time only one thread will be running on a core.</p>

<p>But for cases like web servers, most of these threads won&rsquo;t be doing work. They&rsquo;ll be waiting on the
network. Most of these threads will either be listening for a request, or waiting for their response
to get sent.</p>

<p>With regular threads, when you perform a blocking I/O operation, the syscall returns control
to the kernel, which won&rsquo;t yield control back, because the I/O operation is probably not finished.
Instead, it will use this as an opportunity to swap in a different thread, and will swap the original
thread back when its I/O operation is finished (i.e. it&rsquo;s &ldquo;unblocked&rdquo;). Without Tokio and friends,
this is how you would handle such things in Rust. Spawn a million threads; let the OS deal with
scheduling based on I/O.</p>

<p>But, as we already discovered, threads don&rsquo;t scale well for things like this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We need &ldquo;lighter&rdquo; threads.</p>

<h2>Lightweight threading</h2>

<p>I think the best way to understand lightweight threading is to forget about Rust for a moment
and look at a language that does this well, Go.</p>

<p>So instead, Go has lightweight threads, called &ldquo;goroutines&rdquo;. You spawn these with the <code>go</code>
keyword. A web server might do something like this:</p>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">go</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a loop which waits for new TCP connections, and spawns a goroutine with the connection
and the function <code>handler</code>. Each connection will be a new goroutine, and the goroutine will shut down
when <code>handler</code> finishes. In the meantime, the main loop continues executing, because it&rsquo;s running in
a different goroutine.</p>

<p>So if these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;real&rdquo; (operating system) threads, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p>A goroutine is an example of a &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; thread. The operating system doesn&rsquo;t know about these,
it sees N threads owned by the Go runtime, and the Go runtime maps M goroutines onto them<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, swapping
goroutines in and out much like the operating system scheduler. It&rsquo;s able to do this because
Go code is already interruptible for the GC to be able to run, so the scheduler can always ask goroutines
to stop. The scheduler is also aware of I/O, so when a goroutine is waiting on I/O it yields to the scheduler.</p>

<p>Essentialy, a compiled Go function will have a bunch of points scattered throughout it where it
tells the scheduler and GC &ldquo;take over if you want&rdquo; (and also &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting on stuff, please take
over&rdquo;).</p>

<p>When a goroutine is swapped on an OS thread, some registers will be saved, and
the program counter will switch to the new goroutine.</p>

<p>But what about its stack? OS threads have a large stack with them, and you kinda need a stack for functions
and stuff to work.</p>

<p>What Go used to do was segmented stacks. The reason a thread needs a large stack is that most
programming languages, including C, expect the stack to be contiguous, and stacks can&rsquo;t just be
&ldquo;reallocated&rdquo; like we do with growable buffers since we expect stack data to stay put so that
pointers to stack data to continue to work. So we reserve all the stack we think we&rsquo;ll ever need
(~8MB), and hope we don&rsquo;t need more.</p>

<p>But the expectation of stacks being contiguous isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary. In Go, stacks are made of tiny
chunks. When a function is called, it checks if there&rsquo;s enough space on the stack for it to run, and if not,
allocates a new chunk of stack and runs on it. So if you have thousands of threads doing a small amount of work,
they&rsquo;ll all get thousands of tiny stacks and it will be fine.</p>

<p>These days, Go actually does something different; it <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-stacks-are-handled-in-go/">copies stacks</a>. I mentioned that stacks can&rsquo;t
just be &ldquo;reallocated&rdquo; we expect stack data to stay put. But that&rsquo;s not necessarily true &mdash;
because Go has a GC it knows what all the pointers are <em>anyway</em>, and it can rewrite pointers to
stack data on demand.</p>

<p>Either way, Go&rsquo;s rich runtime lets it handle this stuff well. Goroutines are super cheap, and you can spawn
thousands without your computer having problems.</p>

<p>Rust <em>used</em> to support lightweight/&ldquo;green&rdquo; threads (I believe it used segmented stacks). However, Rust cares
a lot about not paying for things you don&rsquo;t use, and this imposes a penalty on all your code even if you
aren&rsquo;t using green threads, and it was removed pre-1.0.</p>

<h2>Async I/O</h2>

<p>A core building block of this is Async I/O. As mentioned in the previous section,
with regular blocking I/O, the moment you request I/O your thread will not be allowed to run
(&ldquo;blocked&rdquo;) until the operation is done. This is perfect when working with OS threads (the OS
scheduler does all the work for you!), but if you have lightweight threads you instead want to
replace the lightweight thread running on the OS thread with a different one.</p>

<p>Instead, you use non-blocking I/O, where the thread queues a request for I/O with the OS and continues
execution. The I/O request is executed at some later point by the kernel. The thread then needs to ask the
OS &ldquo;Is this I/O request ready yet?&rdquo; before looking at the result of the I/O.</p>

<p>Of course, repeatedly asking the OS if it&rsquo;s done can be tedious and consume resources. This is why
there are system calls like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll"><code>epoll</code></a>. Here, you can bundle together a bunch of unfinished I/O requests,
and then ask the OS to wake up your thread when <em>any</em> of these completes. So you can have a scheduler
thread (a real thread) that swaps out lightweight threads that are waiting on I/O, and when there&rsquo;s nothing
else happening it can itself go to sleep with an <code>epoll</code> call until the OS wakes it up (when one of the I/O
requests completes).</p>

<p>(The exact mechanism involved here is probably more complex)</p>

<p>So, bringing this to Rust, Rust has the <a href="https://github.com/carllerche/mio">mio</a> library, which is a platform-agnostic
wrapper around non-blocking I/O and tools like epoll/kqueue/etc. It&rsquo;s a building block; and while
those used to directly using <code>epoll</code> in C may find it helpful, it doesn&rsquo;t provide a nice programming
model like Go does. But we can get there.</p>

<h2>Futures</h2>

<p>These are another building block. A <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.17/futures/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a> is the promise of eventually having a value
(in fact, in Javascript these are called <code>Promise</code>s).</p>

<p>So for example, you can ask to listen on a network socket, and get a <code>Future</code> back  (actually, a
<code>Stream</code>, which is like a future but for a sequence of values). This <code>Future</code> won&rsquo;t contain the
response <em>yet</em>, but will know when it&rsquo;s ready. You can <code>wait()</code> on a <code>Future</code>, which will block
until you have a result, and you can also <code>poll()</code> it, asking it if it&rsquo;s done yet (it will give you
the result if it is).</p>

<p>Futures can also be chained, so you can do stuff like <code>future.then(|result| process(result))</code>.
The closure passed to <code>then</code> itself can produce another future, so you can chain together
things like I/O operations. With chained futures, <code>poll()</code> is how you make progress; each time
you call it it will move on to the next future provided the existing one is ready.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good abstraction over things like non-blocking I/O.</p>

<p>Chaining futures works much like chaining iterators. Each <code>and_then</code> (or whatever combinator)
call returns a struct wrapping around the inner future, which may contain an additional closure.
Closures themselves carry their references and data with them, so this really ends up being
very similar to a tiny stack!</p>

<h2>🗼 Tokio 🗼</h2>

<p>Tokio&rsquo;s essentially a nice wrapper around mio that uses futures. Tokio has a core
event loop, and you feed it closures that return futures. What it will do is
run all the closures you feed it, use mio to efficiently figure out which futures
are ready to make a step<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and make progress on them (by calling <code>poll()</code>).</p>

<p>This actually is already pretty similar to what Go was doing, at a conceptual level.
You have to manually set up the Tokio event loop (the &ldquo;scheduler&rdquo;), but once you do
you can feed it tasks which intermittently do I/O, and the event loop takes
care of swapping over to a new task when one is blocked on I/O. A crucial difference is
that Tokio is single threaded, whereas the Go scheduler can use multiple OS threads
for execution. However, you can offload CPU-critical tasks onto other OS threads and
use channels to coordinate so this isn&rsquo;t that big a deal.</p>

<p>While at a conceptual level this is beginning to shape up to be similar to what we had for Go, code-
wise this doesn&rsquo;t look so pretty. For the following Go code:</p>

<p>Not pretty. <a href="http://alexcrichton.com/futures-rs/futures/future/fn.loop_fn.html#examples">The code gets worse if you introduce branches and loops</a>. The problem is that in Go we
got the interruption points for free, but in Rust we have to encode this by chaining up combinators
into a kind of state machine. Ew.</p>

<h2>Generators and async/await</h2>

<p>Functions are things which execute a task and return once. On the other hand, generators
return multiple times; they pause execution to &ldquo;yield&rdquo; some data, and can be resumed
at which point they will run until the next yield. While my example doesn&rsquo;t show this, generators
can also finish executing like regular functions.</p>

<p>Closures in Rust are
<a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/">sugar for a struct containing captured data, plus an implementation of one of the <code>Fn</code> traits to make it callable</a>.</p>

<p>Generators are similar, except they implement the <code>Generator</code> trait<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and usually store an enum representing various states.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html#generators-as-state-machines">unstable book</a> has some examples on what the generator state machine enum will look like.</p>

<p>This is much closer to what we were looking for! Now our code can look like this:</p>

<p>where <code>futurify</code> is a function that takes a generator and returns a future which on
each <code>poll</code> call will <code>resume()</code> the generator, and return <code>NotReady</code> until the generator
finishes executing.</p>

<p>But wait, this is even <em>more</em> ugly! What was the point of converting our relatively
clean callback-chaining code into this mess?</p>

<p>Well, if you look at it, this code now looks <em>linear</em>. We&rsquo;ve converted our callback
code to the same linear flow as the Go code, however it has this weird loop-yield boilerplate
and the <code>futurify</code> function and is overall not very neat.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s where <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await">futures-await</a> comes in. <code>futures-await</code> is a procedural macro that
does the last-mile work of packaging away this boilerplate. It essentially lets you write
the above function as</p>

<p>Nice and clean. Almost as clean as the Go code, just that we have explicit <code>await!()</code> calls. These
await calls are basically providing the same function as the interruption points that Go code
gets implicitly.</p>

<p>And, of course, since it&rsquo;s using a generator under the hood, you can loop and branch and do whatever
else you want as normal, and the code will still be clean.</p>

<h2>Tying it together</h2>

<p>So, in Rust, futures can be chained together to provide a lightweight stack-like system. With async/await,
you can neatly write these future chains, and <code>await</code> provides explicit interruption points on each I/O operation.
Tokio provides an event loop &ldquo;scheduler&rdquo; abstraction, which you can feed async functions to, and under the hood it
uses mio to abstract over low level non-blocking I/O primitives.</p>

<p>These are components which can be used independently &mdash; you can use tokio with futures without
using async/await. You can use async/await without using Tokio. For example, I think this would be
useful for Servo&rsquo;s networking stack. It doesn&rsquo;t need to do <em>much</em> parallel I/O (not at the order
of thousands of threads), so it can just use multiplexed OS threads. However, we&rsquo;d still want
to pool threads and pipeline data well, and async/await would help here.</p>

<p>Put together, all these components get something almost as clean as the Go stuff, with a little more
explicit boilerplate. Because generators (and thus async/await) play nice with the borrow checker
(they&rsquo;re just enum state machines under the hood), Rust&rsquo;s safety guarantees are all still in play,
and we get to have &ldquo;fearless concurrency&rdquo; for programs having a huge quantity of I/O bound tasks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week ago <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html">we put out a call for blog posts for what folks think Rust should do in 2018</a>.</p>

<p>This is mine.</p>

<h2>Overall focus</h2>

<p>I think 2017 was a great year for Rust. Near the beginning of the year, after custom derive
and a bunch of things stabilized, I had a strong feeling that Rust was &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. Not really &ldquo;finished&rdquo;,
there&rsquo;s still tons of stuff to improve, but this was the first time stable Rust was the language
I wanted it to be, and was something I could recommend for most kinds of work without reservations.</p>

<p>I think this is a good signal to wind down the frightening pace of new features Rust has been getting.
And that happened! We had the impl period, which took some time to focus on <em>getting things done</em> before
proposing new things. And Rust is feeling more polished than ever.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-2018/">Nick</a>, I feel like 2018 should be boring. I feel like we should focus on polishing what
we have, implementing all the things, and improving our approachability as a language.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to see this as an extended impl period.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m looking for a moratorium on RFCs, really. Hell, in the past few days I&rsquo;ve posted
one pre-pre-RFC<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, one pre-RFC, and one RFC (from the pre-RFC). I&rsquo;m mostly looking for <em>prioritizing</em> impl
work over designing new things, but still having <em>some</em> focus on design.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>

<p>I think Rust still has some &ldquo;missing bits&rdquo; which make it hard to justify for some use cases. Rust&rsquo;s
async story is being fleshed out. We don&rsquo;t yet have stable SIMD or stable inline ASM. The microcontroller
story is kinda iffy. RLS/clippy need nightly. I&rsquo;d like to see these crystallize and stabilize this year.</p>

<p>I think this year we need to continue to take a critical look at Rust&rsquo;s ergonomics. Last year the
ergonomics initiative was really good for Rust, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of that. This is kind of at
odds with my &ldquo;focus on polishing Rust&rdquo; statement, but fixing ergonomics is not just new features. It&rsquo;s
also about figuring out barriers in Rust, polishing mental models, improving docs/diagnostics, and in
general figuring out how to best present Rust&rsquo;s features. Starting dialogues about confusing bits of
the language and figuring out the best mental model to present them with is something we should
continue doing. Sometimes this may need new features, indeed, but not always. We must continue
to take a critical look at how our language presents itself to newcomers.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a stronger focus on mentoring. Mentoring on rustc, mentoring on major libraries, mentoring on
Rust tooling, mentoring everywhere. This includes not just the mentors, but the associated infrastructure &ndash;
contribution docs, sites like <a href="http://starters.servo.org/">servo-starters</a> and <a href="https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork">findwork</a>, and similar tooling.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping for more companies to invest back into Rust. This year <a href="http://buoyant.io/">Buoyant</a> became pretty well
known within the community, and many of their employees are paid to work on various important parts
of the Rust ecosystem. There are also multiple consulting groups that contribute to the ecosystem.
It&rsquo;s nice to see that &ldquo;paid to work on Rust&rdquo; is no longer limited to Mozilla, and this is crucial
for the health of the language. I hope this trend continues.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to see more companies <em>talk</em> about Rust. Success stories are really nice to hear.
I&rsquo;ve heard many amazing success stories this year, but a lot of them are things which can&rsquo;t be shared.</p>

<h2>Governance</h2>

<p>Last year we started seeing the limits of the RFC process. Large RFCs were stressful for both the RFC authors
and participating community members, and rather opaque for newer community members wishing to participate.
Alternative models have been discussed; I&rsquo;d like to see more movement on this front.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to grow the moderation team; it is currently rather small and doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to handle
incidents in a timely fashion.</p>

<h2>Docs / Learning</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a focus on improving Rust for folks who learn the language by <em>trying things</em> over reading books <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This means better diagnostics, better alternative resources like rustbyexample, etc. Improving mentorship helps here
as well.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;d like to see our normal docs work continue to happen.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m overall really excited for 2018. I think we&rsquo;re doing great on most fronts so far, and if we
maintain the momentum we&rsquo;ll have an even-more-awesome Rust by the end of this year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Julia Evans wrote an <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/12/23/segfault-debugging/">excellent post</a> about debugging a segfault in Rust. (Go read it, it&rsquo;s good)</p>

<p>One thing it mentioned was</p>

<blockquote><p>I think “undefined” and “unsafe” are considered to be synonyms.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is &hellip; incorrect. However, we in the Rust community have never really explicitly outlined the
distinction, so that confusion is on us! This blog post is an attempt to clarify the difference of
terminology as used within the Rust community. It&rsquo;s a very useful but subtle distinction and I feel we&rsquo;d be
able to talk about safety more expressively if this was well known.</p>

<h2>Unsafe means two things in Rust, yay</h2>

<p>So, first off, the waters are a bit muddied by the fact that Rust uses <code>unsafe</code> to both mean &ldquo;within
an <code>unsafe {}</code> block&rdquo; block and &ldquo;something Bad is happening here&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s possible to have safe code
within an <code>unsafe</code> block; indeed this is the <em>primary function</em> of an <code>unsafe</code> block. Somewhat
counterintutively, the <code>unsafe</code> block&rsquo;s purpose is to actually tell the compiler &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t
like this code but trust me, it&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo; (where &ldquo;safe&rdquo; is the negation of the <em>second</em> meaning of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;something Bad is not happening here&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Similarly, we use &ldquo;safe code&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;code not using <code>unsafe{}</code> blocks&rdquo; but also &ldquo;code that is not unsafe&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;code where nothing bad happens&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This blog post is primarily about the &ldquo;something bad is happening here&rdquo; meaning of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;. When referring
to the other kind I&rsquo;ll specifically say &ldquo;code within <code>unsafe</code> blocks&rdquo; or something like that.</p>

<h2>Undefined behavior</h2>

<p>In languages like C, C++, and Rust, undefined behavior is when you reach a point where
the compiler is allowed to do anything with your code. This is distinct from implementation-defined
behavior, where usually a given compiler/library will do a deterministic thing, however they have some
freedom from the spec in deciding what that thing is.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior can be pretty scary. This is usually because in practice it causes problems when
the compiler assumes &ldquo;X won&rsquo;t happen because it is undefined behavior&rdquo;, and X ends up happening,
breaking the assumptions. In some cases this does nothing dangerous, but often the compiler will
end up doing wacky things to your code. Dereferencing a null pointer will <em>sometimes</em> cause segfaults
(which is the compiler generating code that actually dereferences the pointer, making the kernel
complain), but sometimes it will be optimized in a way that assumes it won&rsquo;t and moves around code
such that you have major problems.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior is a global property, based on how your code is <em>used</em>. The following function
in C++ or Rust may or may not exhibit undefined behavior, based on how it gets used:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// do not try this at home</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As long as you always call it with a valid pointer to an integer, there is no undefined behavior
involved.</p>

<p>But in either language, if you use it with some pointer conjured out of thin air (or, like <code>0x01</code>), that&rsquo;s
probably undefined behavior.</p>

<p>As it stands, UB is a property of the entire program and its execution. Sometimes you may have snippets of code
that will always exhibit undefined behavior regardless of how they are called, but in general UB
is a global property.</p>

<h2>Unsafe behavior</h2>

<p>Rust&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;unsafe behavior&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m coining this term because &ldquo;unsafety&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsafe code&rdquo; can
be a bit confusing) is far more scoped. Here, <code>fn deref</code> <em>is</em> &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, even if you <em>always</em>
call it with a valid pointer. The reason it is still unsafe is because it&rsquo;s possible to trigger UB by only
changing the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; caller code. I.e. &ldquo;changes to code outside unsafe blocks can trigger UB if they include
calls to this function&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Basically, in Rust a bit of code is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; if it cannot exhibit undefined behavior under all circumstances of
that code being used. The following code exhibits &ldquo;safe behavior&rdquo;:</p>

<p>We dereferenced a raw pointer, but we knew it was valid. Of course, actual <code>unsafe</code> blocks will
usually be &ldquo;actually totally safe&rdquo; for less obvious reasons, and part of this is because
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/working-with-unsafe.html#working-with-unsafe"><code>unsafe</code> blocks sometimes can pollute the entire module</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in Rust is a more local property. Code isn&rsquo;t safe just because you only use it in
a way that doesn&rsquo;t trigger UB, it is safe because there is literally <em>no way to use it such that it
will do so</em>. No way to do so without using <code>unsafe</code> blocks, that is<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a distinction that&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> to draw in Rust because it gives us the ability
to compartmentalize safety. Trying to apply this definition to C++ is problematic; you can
ask &ldquo;is <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> safe?&rdquo;, but you can <em>always</em> use it within code in a way that you trigger
undefined behavior, because C++ does not have the tools for compartmentalizing safety. The distinction
between &ldquo;code which doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about safety&rdquo; and &ldquo;code which does need to worry about safety&rdquo;
exists in Rust in the form of &ldquo;code outside of <code>unsafe {}</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;code within <code>unsafe {}</code>&rdquo;, whereas in
C++ it&rsquo;s a lot fuzzier and based on expectations (and documentation/the spec).</p>

<p>So C++&rsquo;s <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the sense that it does what you expect but
if you use it in a way counter to how it&rsquo;s <em>supposed</em> to be used (constructing one from an invalid pointer, for example)
it can blow up. This is still a useful sense of safety, and is how one regularly reasons about safety in C++. However it&rsquo;s not
the same sense of the term as used in Rust, which can be a bit more formal about what the expectations
actually are.</p>

<p>So <code>unsafe</code> in Rust is a strictly more general concept &ndash; all code exhibiting undefined behavior in Rust is also &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;,
however not all &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; code in Rust exhibits undefined behavior as written in the current program.</p>

<p>Rust furthermore attempts to guarantee that you will not trigger undefined behavior if you do not use <code>unsafe {}</code> blocks.
This of course depends on the correctness of the compiler (it has bugs) and of the libraries you use (they may also have bugs)
but this compartmentalization gets you most of the way there in having UB-free programs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-size"><code>font-size</code></a> is the worst.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a CSS property probably everyone who writes CSS has used at some point. It&rsquo;s pretty ubiquitous.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s <em>super</em> complicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just a number&rdquo;, you say. &ldquo;How can that be complicated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I too felt that way one time. And then I worked on implementing it for <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Stylo">stylo</a>.</p>

<p>Stylo is the project to integrate <a href="http://github.com/servo/servo/">Servo</a>&rsquo;s styling system into Firefox. The styling system handles
parsing CSS, determining which rules apply to which elements, running this through the cascade,
and eventually computing and assigning styles to individual elements in the tree. This happens not
only on page load, but also whenever various kinds of events (including DOM manipulation) occur,
and is a nontrivial portion of pageload and interaction times.</p>

<p>Servo is in <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, and makes use of Rust&rsquo;s safe parallelism in many places, one of them being
styling. Stylo has the potential to bring these speedups into Firefox, along with the added safety
of the code being in a safer systems language.</p>

<p>Anyway, as far as the styling system is concerned, I believe that font-size is the most complex
property it has to handle. Some properties may be more complicated when it comes to layout or
rendering, but font-size is probably the most complex one in the department of styling.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this post can give an idea of how complex the Web can <em>get</em>, and also serve as documentation
for some of these complexities. I&rsquo;ll also try to give an idea of how the styling system works throughout this post.</p>

<p>Alright. Let&rsquo;s see what is so complex about font-size.</p>

<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>The syntax of the property is pretty straightforward. You can specify it as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A length (<code>12px</code>, <code>15pt</code>, <code>13em</code>, <code>4in</code>, <code>8rem</code>)</li>
<li>A percentage (<code>50%</code>)</li>
<li>A compound of the above, via a calc (<code>calc(12px + 4em + 20%)</code>)</li>
<li>An absolute keyword (<code>medium</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>large</code>, <code>x-large</code>, etc)</li>
<li>A relative keyword (<code>larger</code>, <code>smaller</code>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The first three are common amongst quite a few length-related properties. Nothing abnormal in the syntax.</p>

<p>The next two are interesting. Essentially, the absolute keywords map to various pixel values, and match
the result of <code>&lt;font size=foo&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>size=3</code> is the same as <code>font-size: medium</code>). The <em>actual</em> value they map to
is not straightforward, and I&rsquo;ll get to that later in this post.</p>

<p>The relative keywords basically scale the size up or down. The mechanism of the scaling was also complex, however
this has changed. I&rsquo;ll get to that too.</p>

<h2>em and rem units</h2>

<p>First up: <code>em</code> units. One of the things you can specify in <em>any</em> length-based CSS property is a value with an <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>
unit.</p>

<p><code>5em</code> means &ldquo;5 times the <code>font-size</code> of the element this is applied to&rdquo;. <code>5rem</code> means &ldquo;5 times the font-size of the root element&rdquo;</p>

<p>The implications of this are that font-size needs to be computed before all the other properties (well, not quite, but we&rsquo;ll get to that!)
so that it is available during that time.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>em</code> units within <code>font-size</code> itself. In this case, it computed relative to the font-size of the <em>parent</em> element, since
you can&rsquo;t use the font-size of the element to compute itself.</p>

<h2>Minimum font size</h2>

<p>Browsers let you set a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; font size in their preferences, and text will not be scaled below it. It&rsquo;s useful for those with
trouble seeing small text.</p>

<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t affect properties which depend on font-size via <code>em</code> units. So if you&rsquo;re using a minimum font size,
<code>&lt;div style="font-size: 1px; height: 1em; background-color: red"&gt;</code> will have a very tiny height (which you&rsquo;ll notice from the color),
but the text will be clamped to the minimum size.</p>

<p>What this effectively means is that you need to keep track of <em>two</em> separate computed font size values. There&rsquo;s one value that
is used to actually determine the font size used for the text, and one value that is used whenever the style system needs to
know the font-size (e.g. to compute an <code>em</code> unit.)</p>

<p>This gets slightly more complicated when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character">ruby</a> is involved. In ideographic scripts (usually, Han
and Han-based scripts like Kanji or Hanja) it&rsquo;s sometimes useful to have the pronunciation
of each character above it in a phonetic script, for the aid of readers without proficiency in that
script, and this is known as &ldquo;ruby&rdquo; (&ldquo;furigana&rdquo; in Japanese). Because these scripts are ideographic,
it&rsquo;s not uncommon for learners to know the pronunciation of a word but have no idea how to write it.
An example would be <ruby><rb>日</rb><rt>に</rt><rb>本</rb><rt>ほん</rt></ruby>, which is 日本 (&ldquo;nihon&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;Japan&rdquo;) in Kanji with ruby にほん in the phonetic Hiragana script above it.</p>

<p>As you can probably see, the phonetic ruby text is in a smaller font size (usually 50% of the font
size of the main text<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>). The minimum font-size support <em>respects</em> this, and ensures that if the ruby
is supposed to be <code>50%</code> of the size of the text, the minimum font size for the ruby is <code>50%</code> of the
original minimum font size. This avoids clamped text from looking like <ruby><rb>日</rb><rt style="font-size: 1em">に</rt><rb>本</rb><rt style="font-size: 1em">ほん</rt></ruby> (where both get set to
the same size), which is pretty ugly.</p>

<h2>Text zoomm</h2>

<p>Firefox additionally lets you zoom text only when zooming. If you have trouble reading small things, it&rsquo;s great to
be able to just blow up the text on the page without having the whole page get zoomed (which means you need to scroll
around a lot).</p>

<p>In this case, <code>em</code> units of other properties <em>do</em> get zoomed as well. After all, they&rsquo;re supposed to be relative to the text&rsquo;s font
size (and may have some relation to the text), so if that size has changed so should they.</p>

<p>(Of course, that argument could also apply to the min font size stuff. I don&rsquo;t have an answer for why it doesn&rsquo;t.)</p>

<p>This is actually pretty straightforward to implement. When computing absolute font sizes (including
keywords), zoom them if text zoom is on. For everything else continue as normal.</p>

<p>Text zoom is also disabled within <code>&lt;svg:text&gt;</code> elements, which leads to some trickiness here.</p>

<h2>Interlude: How the style system works</h2>

<p>Before I go ahead it&rsquo;s probably worth giving a quick overview of how everything works.</p>

<p>The responsibiltiy of a style system is to take in CSS code and a DOM tree, and assign computed styles to each element.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a distinction between &ldquo;specified&rdquo; and &ldquo;computed&rdquo; here. &ldquo;specified&rdquo; styles are in the format
you specify in CSS, whereas computed styles are those that get attached to the elements, sent to
layout, and inherited from. A given specified style may compute to different values when applied to
different elements.</p>

<p>So while you can <em>specify</em> <code>width: 5em</code>, it will compute to something like <code>width: 80px</code>. Computed values are usually a
cleaned up form of the specified value.</p>

<p>The style system will first parse the CSS, producing a bunch of rules usually containing declarations (a declaration is like <code>width: 20%;</code>; i.e. a property name and a specified value)</p>

<p>It then goes through the tree in top-down order (this is parallelized in Stylo), figuring out which declarations <em>apply</em> to each element
and in which order &ndash; some declarations have precedence over others. Then it will compute each relevant declaration against the element&rsquo;s style (and parent style, among other bits of info),
and store this value in the element&rsquo;s &ldquo;computed style&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of optimizations that Gecko and Servo do here to avoid duplicated work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. There&rsquo;s a
bloom filter for quickly checking if deep descendent selectors apply to a subtree. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;rule
tree&rdquo; that helps cache effort from determining applicable declarations. Computed styles are
reference counted and shared very often (since the default state is to inherit from the parent or
from the default style).</p>

<p>But ultimately, this is the gist of what happens.</p>

<h2>Keyword values</h2>

<p>Alright, this is where it gets complicated.</p>

<p>Remember when I said <code>font-size: medium</code> was a thing that mapped to a value?</p>

<p>So what does it map to?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out, it depends on the font family. For the following HTML:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font: medium monospace&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font: medium sans-serif&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>you get (<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RZgxjw">codepen</a>)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font: medium monospace">text</span>
<span style="font: medium sans-serif">text</span>
</div>


<p>where the first one computes to a font-size of 13px, and the second one computes to a font-size of
16px. You can check this in the computed style pane of your devtools, or by using
<code>getComputedStyle()</code>.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> the reason behind this is that monospace fonts tend to be wider, so the default font size (medium)
is scaled so that they have similar widths, and all other keyword font sizes get shifted as well. The final result is something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/font-size-table.png" width="600"></p>

<p>Firefox and Servo have <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/d415617a5bbe65a73bd805808a7ac76f38a1861c/components/style/properties/longhand/font.mako.rs#L763-L774">a matrix</a> that helps derive the values for all the absolute
font-size keywords based on the &ldquo;base size&rdquo; (i.e. the computed of <code>font-size: medium</code>). Actually,
Firefox has <a href="http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c329d562fb6c6218bdb79290faaf015467ef89e2/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#3272-3341">three tables</a> to support some legacy use cases like quirks mode (Servo has
yet to add support for these tables). We query other parts of the browser for what the &ldquo;base size&rdquo;
is based on the language and font family.</p>

<p>Wait, but what does the language have to do with this anyway? How does the language impact font-size?</p>

<p>It turns out that the base size depends on the font family <em>and</em> the language, and you can configure this.</p>

<p>Both Firefox and Chrome (using an extension) actually let you tweak which fonts get used on a per-language basis,
<em>as well as the default (base) font-size</em>.</p>

<p>This is not as obscure as one might think. Default system fonts are often really ugly for non-Latin-
using scripts. I have a separate font installed that produces better-looking Devanagari ligatures.</p>

<p>Similarly, some scripts are just more intricate than Latin. My default font size for Devanagari is
set to 18 instead of 16. I&rsquo;ve started learning Mandarin and I&rsquo;ve set that font size to 18 as well. Hanzi glyphs
can get pretty complicated and I still struggle to learn (and later recognize) them. A larger font size is great for this.</p>

<p>Anyway, this doesn&rsquo;t complicate things too much.  This does mean that the font family needs to be
computed before font-size, which already needs to be computed before most other properties. The
language, which can be set using a <code>lang</code> HTML attribute, is internally treated as a CSS property by
Firefox since it inherits, and it must be computed earlier as well.</p>

<p>Not too bad. So far.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s the kicker. This <em>dependence</em> on the language and family <em>inherits</em>.</p>

<p>Quick, what&rsquo;s the font-size of the inner <code>div</code>?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 16 --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    font size is 16px
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font-family: monospace&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- base size 13 --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        font size is ??
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For a normal inherited CSS property<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, if the parent has a computed value of <code>16px</code>,
and the child has no additional values specified, the child will inherit a value of <code>16px</code>.
<em>Where</em> the parent got that computed value from doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>Here, <code>font-size</code> &ldquo;inherits&rdquo; a value of <code>13px</code>. You can see this below (<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MvorQQ">codepen</a>):</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<div style="font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"> <!-- base size 16 -->
    font size is 16px
    <div style="font-family: monospace"> <!-- base size 13 -->
        font size is ??
    </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Basically, if the computed value originated from a keyword, whenever the font family or language
change, font-size is recomputed from the original keyword with the new font family and language.</p>

<p>The reason this exists is because otherwise the differing font sizes wouldn&rsquo;t work anyway! The default font size
is <code>medium</code>, so basically the root element gets a <code>font-size: medium</code> and all elements inherit from it. If you change
to monospace or a different language in the document you need the font-size recomputed.</p>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t stop here. This even inherits <em>through relative units</em> (Not in IE).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oewpER">codepen</a>)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block; padding: 15px;">
<div style="font-size: medium; font-family: sans-serif;"> <!-- base size 16 -->
    font size is 16px
    <div style="font-size: 0.9em"> <!-- could also be font-size: 90%-->
        font size is 14.4px (16 * 0.9)
        <div style="font-family: monospace"> <!-- base size 13 -->
            font size is 11.7px! (13 * 0.9)
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>So we&rsquo;re actually inheriting a font-size of <code>0.9*medium</code> when we inherit from the second div, not <code>14.4px</code>.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is whenever the font family or language changes, you should recompute the font-size as if the language and family <em>were always that way</em> up the tree.</p>

<p>Firefox code uses both of these strategies. The original Gecko style system handles this by actually
going back to the top of the tree and recalculating the font size as if the language/family were
different. I suspect this is inefficient, but the rule tree seems to be involved in making this slightly
more efficient</p>

<p>Servo, on the other hand, stores some extra data on the side when computing stuff, data which gets copied over to the child element. It basically
stores the equivalent of saying &ldquo;Yes, this font was computed from a keyword. The keyword was <code>medium</code>, and after that we applied a factor of 0.9 to it.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In both cases, this leads to a bunch of complexities in all the <em>other</em> font-size complexities, since they need to be carefully preserved through this.</p>

<p>In Servo, <em>most</em> of this gets handled <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/longhand/font.mako.rs#L964-L1061">via custom cascading functions for font-size</a>.</p>

<h2>Larger/smaller</h2>

<p>So I mentioned that <code>font-size: larger</code> and <code>smaller</code> scale the size, but didn&rsquo;t mention by what fraction.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#relative-size-value">to the spec</a>, if the font-size currently matches the value of an absolute keyword size (medium/large/etc),
you should pick the value of the next/previous keyword sizes respectively.</p>

<p>If it is <em>between</em> two, find the same point between the next/previous two sizes.</p>

<p>This, of course, must play well with the weird inheritance of keyword font sizes mentioned before. In gecko&rsquo;s model this isn&rsquo;t too hard,
since Gecko recalculates things anyway. In Servo&rsquo;s model we&rsquo;d have to store a sequence of applications of <code>larger</code>/<code>smaller</code> and relative
units, instead of storing just a relative unit.</p>

<p>Additionally, when computing this during text-zoom, you have to unzoom before looking it up in the table, and then rezoom.</p>

<p>Overall, a bunch of complexity for not much gain &mdash; turns out only Gecko actually followed the spec here! All other browser engines
used simple ratios here.</p>

<p>So my fix here <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361550">was simply to remove this behavior from Gecko</a>. That simplified things.</p>

<h2>MathML</h2>

<p>Firefox and Safari support MathML, a markup language for math. It doesn&rsquo;t get used much on the Web these days, but it exists.</p>

<p>MathML has its own complexities when it comes to font-size. Specifically, <code>scriptminsize</code>, <code>scriptlevel</code>, and <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in MathML, the text in the numerator or denominator of a fraction or the text of a superscript is 0.71 times the size of the text outside of it. This is because
the default <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code> for MathML elements is 0.71, and these specific elements all get a default scriptlevel of <code>+1</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, <code>scriptlevel=+1</code> means &ldquo;multiply the font size by <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code>&rdquo;, and
<code>scriptlevel=-1</code> is for dividing. This can be specified via a <code>scriptlevel</code> HTML attribute on an <code>mstyle</code> element. You can
similarly tweak the (inherited) multiplier via the <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code> HTML attribute, and the minimum size via <code>scriptminsize</code>.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</div>


<p>(<a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BdZJgR">codepen</a>)</p>

<p>So this isn&rsquo;t as bad. It&rsquo;s as if <code>scriptlevel</code> is a weird <code>em</code> unit. No biggie, we know how to deal with those already.</p>

<p>Except you also have <code>scriptminsize</code>. This lets you set the minimum font size <em>for changes caused by <code>scriptlevel</code></em>.</p>

<p>This means that <code>scriptminsize</code> will make sure <code>scriptlevel</code> never causes changes that make the font smaller than the min size,
but it will ignore cases where you deliberately specify an <code>em</code> unit or a pixel value.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s already a subtle bit of complexity introduced here, <code>scriptlevel</code> now becomes another thing
that tweaks how <code>font-size</code> inherits. Fortunately, in Firefox/Servo internally <code>scriptlevel</code> (as are
<code>scriptminsize</code> and <code>scriptsizemultiplier</code>) is also handled as a CSS property, which means that we
can use the same framework we used for font-family and language here &ndash; compute the script
properties before font-size, and if <code>scriptlevel</code> is set, force-recalculate the font size even if
font-size itself was not set.</p>

<h3>Interlude: early and late computed properties</h3>

<p>In Servo the way we handle dependencies in properties is to have a set of &ldquo;early&rdquo; properties and a
set of &ldquo;late&rdquo; properties (which are allowed to depend on early properties). We iterate the
declarations twice, once looking for early properties, and once for late. However, now we have a
pretty intricate set of dependencies, where font-size must be calculated after language, font-family,
and the script properties, but before everything else that involves lengths. Additionally, font-family
has to be calculated after all the other early properties due to another font complexity I&rsquo;m not covering here.</p>

<p>The way we handle this is to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3195-L3204">pull font-size and font-family</a> out during the early computation,
but not deal with them until <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3211-L3327">after the early computation is done</a>.</p>

<p>At that stage we first <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3219-L3233">handle the disabling of text-zoom</a>, and then handle <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3235-L3277">the complexities of font-family</a>.</p>

<p>We then <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3280-L3303">compute the font family</a>. If a font size was specified, we <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3305-L3309">just compute that</a>. If it
was not, but a font family, lang, or scriptlevel was specified, we <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/properties.mako.rs#L3310-L3324">force compute as inherited</a>, which handles all the constraints.</p>

<h3>Why scriptminsize gets complicated</h3>

<p>Unlike with the other &ldquo;minimum font size&rdquo;, using an <code>em</code> unit in any property will calculate the
length with the clamped value, not the &ldquo;if nothing had been clamped&rdquo; value, when the font size has
been clamped with scriptminsize. So at first glance handling this seems straightforward; only
consider the script min size when deciding to scale because of scriptlevel.</p>

<p>As always, it&rsquo;s not that simple 😀:</p>

<p>Basically, if you increase the level a bunch of times after hitting the min size, decreasing it by one should not immediately
compute <code>min size / multiplier</code>. That would make things asymmetric; something with a net script level of <code>+5</code> should
have the same size as something with a net script level of <code>+6 -1</code>, provided the multiplier hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>So what happens is that the script level is calculated against the font size <em>as if scriptminsize had never applied</em>,
and we only use that size if it is greater than the min size.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just a matter of keeping track of the script level at which clamping happened &ndash; the multiplier could change
in the process and you need to keep track of that too. So this ends up in creating <em>yet another font-size value to inherit</em>.</p>

<p>To recap, we are now at <em>four</em> different notions of font size being inherited:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main font size used by styling</li>
<li>The &ldquo;actual&rdquo; font size, i.e. the main font size but clamped by the min size</li>
<li>(In servo only) The &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; size; i.e. the size stored as a keyword and ratio, if it was derived from a keyword</li>
<li>The &ldquo;script unconstrained&rdquo; size; the font size as if scriptminsize never existed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another complexity here is that the following should still work:</p>

<p>Basically, if you were already below the scriptminsize, reducing the script level (to increase the font size) should not get clamped, since then you&rsquo;d get something too large.</p>

<p>This basically means you only apply scriptminsize if you are applying the script level to a value <em>greater than</em> the script min size.</p>

<p>In Servo, all of the MathML handling culminates in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/53c6f8ea8bf1002d0c99c067601fe070dcd6bcf1/components/style/properties/gecko.mako.rs#L2304-L2403">this wonderful function that is more comment than code</a>, and
some code in the functions near it.</p>

<hr />

<p>So there you have it. <code>font-size</code> is actually pretty complicated. A lot of the web platform has hidden complexities like this, and it&rsquo;s always fun to encounter more of them.</p>

<p>(Perhaps less fun when I have to implement them 😂)</p>

<p>Interestingly, in Firefox, this number is 50% for all ruby <em>except</em> for when the language is Taiwanese Mandarin (where it is 30%). This is because Taiwan uses a phonetic script called Bopomofo, and each Han glyph can be represented as a maximum of 3 Bopomofo letters. So it is possible to choose a reasonable minimum size such that the ruby never extends the size of the glyph below it. On the other hand, pinyin can be up to six letters, and Hiranaga up to (I think) 5, and the corresponding &ldquo;no overflow&rdquo; scaling will be too tiny. So fitting them on top of the glyph is not a consideration and instead we elect to have a larger font size for better readability. Additionally, Bopomofo ruby is often set on the side of the glyph instead of on top, and 30% works better there.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot these days. In part because of <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/issues/1737">an idea I had</a>
but also due to <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/863829482645340160">this twitter discussion</a>.</p>

<p>When teaching most things, there are two non-mutually-exclusive ways of approaching the problem. One
is &ldquo;proactive&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, which is where the teacher decides a learning path beforehand, and executes it. The
other is &ldquo;reactive&rdquo;, where the teacher reacts to the student trying things out and dynamically
tailors the teaching experience.</p>

<p>Most in-person teaching experiences are a mix of both. Planning beforehand is very important whilst teaching,
but tailoring the experience to the student&rsquo;s reception of the things being taught is important too.</p>

<p>In person, you <em>can</em> mix these two, and in doing so you get a &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; situation. Yay!</p>

<p>But &hellip; we don&rsquo;t really learn much programming in a classroom setup.
Sure, some folks learn the basics in college for a few years, but everything
they learn after that isn&rsquo;t in a classroom situation where this can work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
I&rsquo;m an autodidact,
and while I have taken a few programming courses for random interesting things, I&rsquo;ve taught myself most of what I know
using various sources. I care a lot about improving the situation here.</p>

<p>With self-driven learning we have a similar divide. The &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; model corresponds to reading books
and docs. Various people have proactively put forward a path for learning in the form of a book
or tutorial. It&rsquo;s up to you to pick one, and follow it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; model is not so well-developed. In the context of self-driven learning in programming,
it&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;do things, make mistakes, hope that Google/Stackoverflow help&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s how
a lot of people learn programming; and it&rsquo;s how I prefer to learn programming.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very nice to be able to &ldquo;learn along the way&rdquo;. While this is a long and arduous process,
involving many false starts and a lack of a sense of progress, it can be worth it in terms of
the kind of experience this gets you.</p>

<p>But as I mentioned, this isn&rsquo;t as well-developed. With the proactive approach, there still
is a teacher &ndash; the author of the book! That teacher may not be able to respond in real time,
but they&rsquo;re able to set forth a path for you to work through.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with the &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; approach, there is no teacher. Sure, there are
Random Answers on the Internet, which are great, but they don&rsquo;t form a coherent story.
Neither can you really be your own teacher for a topic you do not understand.</p>

<p>Yet plenty of folks do this. Plenty of folks approach things like learning a new language by reading
at most two pages of docs and then just diving straight in and trying stuff out. The only language I
have not done this for is the first language I learned<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s unfortunate that folks who prefer this approach don&rsquo;t get the benefit of a teacher.
In the reactive approach, teachers can still tell you what you&rsquo;re doing wrong and steer you away from
tarpits of misunderstanding. They can get you immediate answers and guidance. When we look
for answers on stackoverflow, we get some of this, but it also involves a lot of pattern-matching
on the part of the student, and we end up with a bad facsimile of what a teacher can do for you.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s possible to construct a better teacher for this!</p>

<p>In fact, examples of this exist in the wild already!</p>

<p>The Elm compiler is my favorite example of this. <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants">It has amazing error messages</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/elm-error.png">
<img class="center" src="/images/post/elm-error2.png"></p>

<p>The error messages tell you what you did wrong, sometimes suggest fixes, and help
correct potential misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Rust does this too. Many compilers do. (Elm is exceptionally good at it)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/rust-error.png" width="700"></p>

<p>One thing I particularly like about Rust is that from that error you can

<p>Anyway, diagnostics basically provide a reactive component to learning programming. I&rsquo;ve cared about
diagnostics in Rust for a long time, and I often remind folks that many things taught through the
docs can/should be taught through diagnostics too. Especially because diagnostics are a kind of soapbox
for compiler writers &mdash; you can&rsquo;t guarantee that your docs will be read, but you can guarantee
that your error messages will. These days, while I don&rsquo;t have much time to work on stuff myself I&rsquo;m
very happy to mentor others working on improving diagnostics in Rust.</p>

<p>Only recently did I realize <em>why</em> I care about them so much &ndash; they cater exactly to my approach
to learning programming languages! If I&rsquo;m not going to read the docs when I get started and try the
reactive approach, having help from the compiler is invaluable.</p>

<p>I think this space is relatively unexplored. Elm might have the best diagnostics out there,
and as diagnostics (helping all users of a language &ndash; new and experienced), they&rsquo;re great,
but as a teaching tool for newcomers; they still have a long way to go. Of course, compilers
like Rust are even further behind.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to experiment with is a first-class tool for reactive teaching. In a sense,
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">clippy</a> is already something like this. Clippy looks out for antipatterns, and tries to help
teach. But it also does many other things, and not all are teaching moments are antipatterns.</p>

<p>For example, in C, this isn&rsquo;t necessarily an antipattern:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">thingy</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">do_the_thing</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">frob</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Many C codebases use <code>if (foo = bar())</code>. It is a potential footgun if you confuse it with <code>==</code>,
but there&rsquo;s no way to be sure. Many compilers now have a warning for this that you can silence by
doubling the parentheses, though.</p>

<p>In Rust, this isn&rsquo;t an antipattern either:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// num is still 0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For someone new to Rust, they may feel that the way to have a function mutate arguments (like <code>num</code>) passed to it
is to use something like <code>mut x: u8</code>. What this actually does is copies <code>num</code> (because <code>u8</code> is a <code>Copy</code> type),
and allows you to mutate the copy within the scope of the function. The right way to make a function that
mutates arguments passed to it by-reference would be to do something like <code>fn add_one(x: &amp;mut u8)</code>.
If you try the <code>mut x</code> thing for non-Copy values, you&rsquo;d get a &ldquo;reading out of moved value&rdquo; error
when you try to access <code>num</code> after calling <code>add_one</code>. This would help you figure out what you did wrong,
and potentially that error could detect this situation and provide more specific help.</p>

<p>But for <code>Copy</code> types, this will just compile. And it&rsquo;s not an antipattern &ndash; the way this works
makes complete sense in the context of how Rust variables work, and is something that you do need
to use at times.</p>

<p>So we can&rsquo;t even warn on this. Perhaps in &ldquo;pedantic clippy&rdquo; mode, but really, it&rsquo;s not
a pattern we want to discourage. (At least in the C example that pattern is one
that many people prefer to forbid from their codebase)</p>

<p>But it would be nice if we could tell a learning programmer &ldquo;hey, btw, this is what this syntax
means, are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo;. With explanations and the ability to dismiss the error.</p>

<p>In fact, you don&rsquo;t even need to restrict this to potential footguns!</p>

<p>You can detect various things the learner is trying to do. Are they probably mixing up <code>String</code>
and <code>&amp;str</code>? Help them! Are they writing a trait? Give a little tooltip explaining the feature.</p>

<p>This is beginning to remind me of the original &ldquo;office assistant&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a>, which was super annoying.
But an opt-in tool or IDE feature which gives helpful suggestions could still be nice, especially
if you can strike a balance between being so dense it is annoying and so sparse it is useless.</p>

<p>It also reminds me of well-designed tutorial modes in games. Some games have a tutorial mode that guides you
through a set path of doing things. Other games, however, have a tutorial mode that will give you hints even
if you stray off the beaten path. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi">Michael</a> tells me that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey/">Prey</a> is
a recent example of such a game.</p>

<p>This really feels like it fits the &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; model I prefer. The student gets to mold their own
journey, but gets enough helpful hints and nudges from the &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; (the tool) so that they
don&rsquo;t end up wasting too much time and can make informed decisions on how to proceed learning.</p>

<p>Now, rust-clippy isn&rsquo;t exactly the place for this kind of tool. This tool needs the ability to globally
&ldquo;silence&rdquo; a hint once you&rsquo;ve learned it. rust-clippy is a linter, and while you can silence lints in
your code, you can&rsquo;t silence them globally for the current user. Nor does that really make sense.</p>

<p>But rust-clippy does have the infrastructure for writing stuff like this, so it&rsquo;s an ideal prototyping
point. I&rsquo;ve filed <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/issues/1737">this issue</a> to discuss this topic.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&rsquo;d love to see this as an IDE feature.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see more experimentation in the department of &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; teaching &mdash; not just tools like this.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The module and import system in Rust is sadly one of the many confusing things you have to deal with whilst
learning the language. A lot of these confusions stem from a misunderstanding of how it works.
In explaining this I&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s usually a common set of misunderstandings.</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/youre-doing-it-wrong/">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo;</a>, I want to try and explain one
&ldquo;right&rdquo; way of looking at it. You can go pretty far<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> without knowing this, but it&rsquo;s useful
and helps avoid confusion.</p>

<hr />

<p><br></p>

<p>First off, just to get this out of the way, <code>mod foo;</code> is basically a way of saying
&ldquo;look for <code>foo.rs</code> or <code>foo/mod.rs</code> and make a module named <code>foo</code> with its contents&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s the same as <code>mod foo { ... }</code> except the contents are in a different file. This
itself can be confusing at first, but it&rsquo;s not what I wish to focus on here. The Rust book explains this more
in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html#multiple-file-crates">the chapter on modules</a>.</p>

<p>In the examples here I will just be using <code>mod foo { ... }</code> since multi-file examples are annoying,
but keep in mind that the stuff here applies equally to multi-file crates.</p>

<h3>Motivating examples</h3>

<p>To start off, I&rsquo;m going to provide some examples of Rust code which compiles. Some of these may be
counterintuitive, based on your existing model.</p>

<p>These examples remind me of the &ldquo;point at infinity&rdquo; in elliptic curve crypto or fake particles in
physics or fake lattice elements in various fields of CS<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Sometimes, for something to make sense,
you add in things that don&rsquo;t normally exist. Similarly, these examples may contain code which
is not traditional Rust style, but the import system
still makes more sense when you include them.</p>

<h3>Imports</h3>

<p>The core confusion behind how imports work can really be resolved by remembering two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>use foo::bar::baz</code> resolves <code>foo</code> relative to the root module (<code>lib.rs</code> or <code>main.rs</code>)

<ul>
<li>You can resolve relative to the current module by explicily trying <code>use self::foo::bar::baz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>foo::bar::baz</code> within your code<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> resolves <code>foo</code> relative to the current module

<ul>
<li>You can resolve relative to the root by explicitly using <code>::foo::bar::baz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s actually &hellip; it. There are no further caveats. The rest of this is modelling what
constitutes as &ldquo;being within a module&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a pretty standard setup, where <code>extern crate</code> declarations are placed in the the root
module:</p>

<p>When we say <code>extern crate regex</code>, we pull in the <code>regex</code> crate into the crate root. This behaves
pretty similar to <code>mod regex { /* contents of regex crate */}</code>. Basically, we&rsquo;ve imported
the crate into the crate root, and since all <code>use</code> paths are relative to the crate root,
<code>use regex::Regex</code> works fine inside the module.</p>

<p>Inline in code, <code>regex::Regex</code> won&rsquo;t work because as mentioned before inline paths are relative
to the current module. However, you can try <code>::regex::Regex::new("")</code>.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;ve imported <code>regex::Regex</code> in <code>mod foo</code>, that name is now accessible to everything inside
the module directly, so the code can just say <code>Regex::new()</code>.</p>

<p>The way you can view this is that <code>use blah</code> and <code>extern crate blah</code> create an item named
<code>blah</code> &ldquo;within the module&rdquo;, which is basically something like a symbolic link, saying
&ldquo;yes this item named <code>blah</code> is actually elsewhere but we&rsquo;ll pretend it&rsquo;s within the module&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no function named <code>replace</code> in the module <code>foo</code>! But the compiler seems to think there is?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because <code>use std::mem::replace</code> basically is equivalent to there being something like:</p>

<p>except it&rsquo;s actually like a symlink to the function defined in <code>std::mem</code>. Because inline paths
are relative to the current module, saying <code>use std::mem::replace</code> works as if you had defined
a function <code>replace</code> in the same module, and you can refer to <code>replace()</code> without needing
any extra qualification in inline paths.</p>

<p>This also makes <code>pub use</code> fit perfectly in our model. <code>pub use</code> says &ldquo;make this symlink, but let
others see it too&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Folks often get annoyed when this doesn&rsquo;t work:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As mentioned before, <code>use</code> paths are relative to the root module. There is no <code>mem</code>
in the root module, so this won&rsquo;t work. We can make it work via <code>self</code>, which I mentioned
before:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Note that this brings overloading of the <code>self</code> keyword up to a grand total of <em>four</em>! Two cases
which occur in the import/path system:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>use self::foo</code> means &ldquo;find me <code>foo</code> within the current module&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>use foo::bar::{self, baz}</code> is equivalent to <code>use foo::bar; use foo::bar::baz;</code></li>
<li><code>fn foo(&amp;self)</code> lets you define methods and specify if the receiver is by-move, borrowed, mutably borrowed, or other</li>
<li><code>Self</code> within implementations lets you refer to the type being implemented on</li>
</ul>


<p>Oh well, at least it&rsquo;s not <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://play.integer32.com/?gist=49415d74214b07b13c236ce88bdf54aa&amp;version=undefined">playpen</a>)</p>

<p>It should be clearer now why this works. The root module imports <code>mem</code>. Now, from everyone&rsquo;s point
of view, there&rsquo;s an item called <code>mem</code> in the root.</p>

<p>Within <code>mod foo</code>, <code>use mem::transmute</code> works because <code>use</code> is relative to the root, and <code>mem</code>
already exists in the root! When you <code>use</code> something, all child modules will see it as if it were
actually belonging to the module. (Non-child modules won&rsquo;t see it because of privacy, we
saw an example of this already)</p>

<p>This is why <code>use foo::transmute</code> works from <code>mod bar</code>, too. <code>bar</code> can refer to the contents
of <code>foo</code> via <code>use foo::whatever</code>, since <code>foo</code> is a child of the root module, and <code>use</code> is relative
to the root. <code>foo</code> already has an item named <code>transmute</code> inside it because it imported one.
Nothing in the parent module is private from the child, so we can <code>use foo::transmute</code> from
<code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>Generally, the standard way of doing things is to either not use modules (just a single lib.rs),
or, if you do use modules, put nothing other than <code>extern crate</code>s and <code>mod</code>s in the root.
This is why we rarely see shenanigans like the above; there&rsquo;s nothing in the root crate
to import, aside from other crates specified by <code>extern crate</code>. The trick of
&ldquo;reimport something from the parent module&rdquo; is also pretty rare because there&rsquo;s basically no
point to using that (just import it directly!). So this is not the kind of code
you&rsquo;ll see in the wild.</p>

<hr />

<p><br></p>

<p>Basically, the way the import system works can be summed up as:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>extern crate</code> and <code>use</code> will act as if they were defining the imported item in the current module, like a symbolic link</li>
<li><code>use foo::bar::baz</code> resolves the path relative to the root module</li>
<li><code>foo::bar::baz</code> in an inline path (i.e. not in a <code>use</code>) will resolve relative to the current module</li>
<li><code>::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the root module</li>
<li><code>self::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the current module</li>
<li><code>super::foo::bar::baz</code> will <em>always</em> resolve relative to the parent module</li>
</ul>


<p>Alright, on to the other half of this. Privacy.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>So how does privacy work?</p>

<p>Privacy, too, follows some basic rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you can access a module, you can access all of its <code>pub</code> contents</li>
<li>A module can always access its child modules, but not recursively

<ul>
<li>This means that a module cannot access private items in its children, nor can it access private grandchildren modules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A child can always access its parent modules (and their parents), and <em>all</em> their contents</li>
<li><code>pub(restricted)</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1422-pub-restricted.md">is a proposal</a> which extends this a bit, but it&rsquo;s experimental so we won&rsquo;t deal with it here</li>
</ul>

<p>We are able to write the path <code>foo::bar::baz::bazfunc</code> even though <code>bar</code> is private!</p>

<p>This is because we still have <em>access</em> to the module <code>bar</code>, by being a descendent module.</p>

<p>This is because most of these misunderstandings lead to a model where you think fewer things compile, which is fine as long as it isn&rsquo;t too restrictive.

<p>One example closer to home is how Rust does lifetime resolution. Lifetimes form a lattice with <code>'static</code> being the bottom element.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whose words are these I think I know<br>
His house is in the village though<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To interpret his work as I go<br></p>

<p>My little student must think it queer<br>
To read without some context near<br>
Between the words and the intent<br>
He wonders what the poem meant<br></p>

<p>He gives his head a little shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what the author said!&rdquo;<br>
Providing another view instead<br></p>

<p>The words are lovely, dark, and deep<br>
But I have literary criticism to preach<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br></p>

<p>Seriously though, try reading <em>The Road Not Taken</em> as metacircular commentary on how the poem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#Analysis">is very often &ldquo;mis&#8221;interpreted</a>, and the nature of interpretation / <em>Death of the Author</em>. It fits perfectly when
you read &ldquo;road&rdquo; as &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;.</p>

<p><small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m only going to be changing the contents of <code>main()</code> here.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is that a non-<code>Copy</code> type, <code>Foo</code>, is returned in an <code>Option</code>. In one case,
we have a reference to the <code>Foo</code>, and in another case an owned copy.</p>

<p>We want to set a variable to these, but of course we can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re different types.</p>

<p>In one case, we have an owned <code>Foo</code>, and we can usually obtain a borrow from an owned type. For
<code>Option</code>, there&rsquo;s a convenience method <code>.as_ref()</code> that does this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Let&rsquo;s try using that (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=41c3f836b9485c216ccb05c257ae5326&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>):</p>

<p>The problem is, <code>thing.get_owned()</code> returns an owned value. There&rsquo;s nothing that it gets anchored to
(we don&rsquo;t set its value to a variable), so it is just a temporary &ndash; we can call methods on it, but
once we&rsquo;re done the value will go out of scope.</p>

<p>What we want is something like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_owned</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">owned</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>but this will still give a borrow error &ndash; <code>owned</code> will still go out of scope within the <code>if</code> block,
and we need the reference to it last as long as <code>maybe_foo</code> (outside the block) is supposed to last.</p>

<p>So this is no good.</p>

<p>An alternate solution here <em>can</em> be copying/cloning the <code>Foo</code> in the <em>first</em> case by calling <code>.map(|x|
x.clone())</code> or <code>.cloned()</code> or something. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to clone, so this isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Another solution here &ndash; the generic advice for dealing with values which may be owned or borrow &ndash;
is to use <code>Cow</code>. It does incur a runtime check, though; one which can be optimized out if things are
inlined enough.</p>

<p>What we need to do here is to extend the lifetime of the temporary returned by <code>thing.get_owned()</code>.
We need to extend it <em>past</em> the scope of the <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to have an <code>Option</code> outside that scope which we mutate (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=7868045f2cebec6d23e7a065f5823767&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>).</p>

<p>This works in this case, but in this case we already had an <code>Option</code>. If <code>get_ref()</code> and <code>get_owned()</code>
returned <code>&amp;Foo</code> and <code>Foo</code> respectively, then we&rsquo;d need to do something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which is icky since it introduces an unwrap.</p>

<p>What we really need is a way to signal to the compiler that it needs to hold on to that temporary
for the scope of the enclosing block.</p>

<p>We can do that! (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1ddf2a428e73b01baa72acdad7cbbf2b&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>)</p>

<p>We know that Rust doesn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo; variables. If you want to name a variable, you have to
initialize it. <code>let foo;</code> feels rather like magic in this context, because it looks like we&rsquo;ve declared
an uninitialized variable.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s less well known is that Rust <em>can</em> do &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; initialization. Here, you declare a variable
and can initialize it later, but expressions involving the variable can only exist in branches
where the compiler knows it has been initialized.</p>

<p>This is the case here. We declared the <code>owned</code> variable beforehand. It now lives in the outer scope
and won&rsquo;t be destroyed until the end of the outer scope. However, the variable cannot be used directly
in an expression in the first branch, or after the <code>if</code>. Doing so will give a compile time error
saying <code>use of possibly uninitialized variable: `owned`</code>. We can only use it in the <code>else</code> branch
because the compiler can see that it is unconditionally initialized in that branch.</p>

<p>We can still read the value of <code>owned</code> indirectly through <code>maybe_foo</code> from outside the branch.
This is okay because the storage of <code>owned</code> is guaranteed to live as long as the outer scope,
and <code>maybe_foo</code> borrows from it. The only time <code>maybe_foo</code> is set to a value inside <code>owned</code> is when
<code>owned</code> has been initialized, so it is safe.</p>
