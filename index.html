  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about improving Rust&rsquo;s governance model lately. As we decompress from last year&rsquo;s hectic edition work, we&rsquo;re slowly starting to look at all the bits of <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1073088515041198080">debt</a> we accumulated, and <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/">organizational debt</a> is high on that list.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking in private with people about a bunch of these things for quite a while now, and I felt it worthwhile to write down as much of my thoughts as I can before the Rust All Hands in Berlin this week.</p>

<p>In the interest of brevity<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;m going to assume the reader is roughly familiar with most of the stuff that&rsquo;s happened with the Rust community in the past few years. I&rsquo;m probably going to omit concrete examples of incidents, both to avoid mischaracterizing individual actions (as with most such analyses, I wish to talk in more general terms about trends), and also just because it would take me forever to write this if I were to supply all the layers of context. If you feel something is inaccurate, please let me know.</p>

<p>This blog post is probably going to reach the eyes of non-Rust-community members. You&rsquo;re welcome to read it, but please accept my apologies in advance if it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. This is something that I initially planned to circulate as a private post (writing for a general audience is <em>hard</em>), but I felt this would be more widely useful. However due to time constraints I haven&rsquo;t had time to edit it to make it acceptable to a wider audience.</p>

<h2>The symptoms</h2>

<p>Before I actually get into it, I&rsquo;d like to carefully delineate <em>what</em> the problem is that I&rsquo;m talking about. Or more accurately, the <em>symptoms</em> I am talking about &mdash; as I&rsquo;ll explain soon I feel like these are not the actual problem but symptoms of a more general problem.</p>

<p>Basically, as time has gone by our decisionmaking process has become more and more arduous, both for community members and the teams. Folks have to deal with:</p>

<ul>
<li>The same arguments getting brought up over and over again</li>
<li>Accusations of bad faith</li>
<li>Derailing</li>
<li>Not feeling heard</li>
<li>Just getting exhausted by all the stuff that&rsquo;s going on</li>
</ul>


<p>The RFC process is the primary exhibitor of these symptoms, but semi-official consensus-building threads on <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org">https://internals.rust-lang.org</a> have similar problems.</p>

<p>Aaron <a href="http://aturon.github.io/2018/05/25/listening-part-1/">has written some extremely empathetic blog posts</a> about a bunch of these problems, starting with concrete examples and ending with a takeaway of a bunch of values for us to apply as well as thoughts on what our next steps can be. I highly recommend you read them if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>

<h2>The scaling problem</h2>

<p>I contend that all of these issues are symptoms of an underlying <em>scaling issue</em>, but also a failure of how our moderation works.</p>

<p>The scaling issue is somewhat straightforward. Such forum discussions are inherently N-to-N discussions. When you leave a comment, you&rsquo;re leaving a comment for <em>everyone</em> to read and interpret, and this is hard to get right. It&rsquo;s <em>much</em> easier to have one-on-one discussions because it&rsquo;s easy to build a shared vocabulary and avoid misunderstandings. Any misunderstandings can often be quickly detected and corrected.</p>

<p>I find that most unpleasant technical arguments stem from an unenumerated mismatch of assumptions, or sometimes what I call a mismatch of axioms (i.e. when there is fundamental conflict between core beliefs). A mismatch of assumptions, if identified, can be resolved, leading to an amicable conclusion. Mismatches of axioms are harder to resolve, however recognizing them can take most of the vitriol out of an argument, because both parties will <em>understand</em> each other, even if they don&rsquo;t <em>agree</em>. In such situations the end result may leave one or both parties <em>unhappy</em>, but rarely <em>angry</em>. (It&rsquo;s also not necessary that axiom mismatches leave people unhappy, embracing <a href="http://aturon.github.io/2018/06/02/listening-part-2/#pluralism-and-positive-sums">positive sum thinking</a> helps us come to mutually beneficial conclusions)</p>

<p>All of these mismatches are easy to identify in one-on-one discussions, because it&rsquo;s easy to switch gears to the meta discussion for a bit.</p>

<p>One-on-one discussions are pleasant. They foster empathy.</p>

<p>N-to-N discussions are <em>not</em>. It&rsquo;s harder to converge on this shared vocabulary amongst N other people. It&rsquo;s harder to identify these mismatches, partly because it&rsquo;s hard to switch into the meta-mode of a discussion at all, but also because there&rsquo;s a lot going on. It&rsquo;s harder to build empathy.</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve grown, discussion complexity has grown quadratically, and we&rsquo;re not really attempting to relinearize them.</p>

<h3>Hanabi and parallel universes</h3>

<p>I quite enjoy the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)">Hanabi</a>. It&rsquo;s a game of information and trust, and I find it extremely fun, especially with the right group.</p>

<p>Hanabi is a cooperative game. You can see everyone&rsquo;s cards (or tiles) but your own, and information-sharing is severely restricted. The goal is to play the right cards in the right order to collectively win. The gimmick is to share additional information through the side-channel of <em>the choice of move you make</em>.</p>

<p>A very common occurrence in this game is that people start making plans in their mind. You typically have a decent understanding of what information everyone has, and you can use this to make predictions as to what everyone&rsquo;s moves will be. With this in mind, you can attempt to &ldquo;set up&rdquo; situations where the game progresses rapidly in a short period of time. This is somewhat necessary for the game to work, but a common pitfall is for these plans to be <em>extremely</em> elaborate, leading to frustration as the game doesn&rsquo;t actually play out as planned.</p>

<p>The core issue behind this is forgetting that you actually <em>can&rsquo;t</em> see the entire game state, since your own cards are hidden. It&rsquo;s not just <em>you</em> who has plans &mdash; everyone does! And each of those plans is incomplete since they&rsquo;re missing a piece of the picture, just as you are.</p>

<p>In Hanabi it&rsquo;s very easy to forget that you&rsquo;re missing a piece of the picture &mdash; in competitive card games you mostly can&rsquo;t see the game state since everyone else&rsquo;s cards are hidden. But in Hanabi you can see <em>most</em> of the cards and it&rsquo;s easy to forget that your own four cards are hidden from you.</p>

<p>So what ends up happening is that due to incomplete information, everyone is operating in their own little parallel universe, occasionally getting frustrated when it becomes clear that other players are not operating in the same universe. As long as you recognize the existence of these parallel universes beforehand you&rsquo;re fine, but if you don&rsquo;t you will be frustrated.</p>

<p>This is largely true of N-to-N discussions as well. Because most of what&rsquo;s being said makes sense to an individual in a particular way, it&rsquo;s very easy for them to forget that other people may not share your assumptions and thus may be on a different page. Every time someone leaves a comment, different people may interpret it differently, &ldquo;forking&rdquo; the common understanding of the state of the discussion into multiple parallel universes. Eventually there are enough parallel universes that everyone&rsquo;s talking past each other.</p>

<p>One thing I often prefer doing in such cases is to have a one on one discussion with people who disagree with me &mdash; typically the shared understanding that is the end result of such discussions is super useful and can be brought back to the discussion as something that all participants interpret the same way. I&rsquo;m not consistent in doing this &mdash; in the midst of a heated argument it&rsquo;s easy to get too wrapped up in the argument to think about getting results and I&rsquo;ve certainly had my time arguing instead of resolving &mdash; but overall whenever I&rsquo;ve chosen to do this it&rsquo;s been a useful policy.</p>

<p>This is a good example of how relinearization and communication can help move N-to-N discussions along. Operating in different parallel universes is kind of the <em>point</em> of Hanabi, but it&rsquo;s not the point of having a technical discussion.</p>

<h2>The moderation problem</h2>

<p>In a technical discussion, broadly speaking, I find that there are three kinds of comments disagreeing with you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Constructive: Comments which disagree with you constructively. We&rsquo;re glad these exist, disagreement can hurt but is necessary for us to collaboratively reach the best outcomes.</li>
<li>Disruptive: Comments which may be written in good faith but end up being disruptive. For example, this includes people who don&rsquo;t read enough of the discussion and end up rehashing the same points. It also includes taking discussions off topic. These kinds of things are problematic but not covered by the code of conduct.</li>
<li>Abrasive: Comments which are rude/abrasive. These are covered by the code of conduct. The mod team tries to handle these.</li>
</ul>


<p>(For a long time I and <a href="http://twitter.com/aaron_turon/">Aaron</a> had a shared vocabulary of &ldquo;Type A, B, C&rdquo; for these, mostly because I&rsquo;m often unimaginative when it comes to such things, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mark-simulacrum">Mark</a> for coming up with, better, descriptive titles)</p>

<p>Note that while I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; comments it&rsquo;s not a judgement on the <em>intent</em> of the participants, but rather a judgement on the harm it has caused.</p>

<p>The second category &ndash; disruptive comments &ndash; are the thing we&rsquo;re currently unable to handle well. They snowball pretty badly too &mdash; as more and more of these collect, more and more people get frustrated and in turn leave comments that cause further disruption. As the discussion progresses into more and more &ldquo;parallel universes&rdquo; it also just becomes <em>easier</em> for a comment to be disruptive.</p>

<p>The Rust moderation team operates mostly passively, we simply don&rsquo;t have the scale<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to watch for and nip these things in the bud. Active moderation requires a degree of involvement we cannot provide. So while the best response would be to work with participants and resolve issues early as we see them crop up, we typically get pulled in at a point where some participants are already causing harm, and our response has to be more severe. It&rsquo;s a bit of a catch-22: it&rsquo;s not exactly our job to deal with this stuff<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but by the time it <em>becomes</em> our job (or even, by the time we <em>notice</em>), most acceptable actions for us to take are extremely suboptimal. The problem with passive moderation is that it&rsquo;s largely reactive &mdash; it&rsquo;s harder to proactively nudge the discussion in the right direction when you don&rsquo;t even <em>notice</em> what&rsquo;s going on until it&rsquo;s too late. This is largely okay for dealing with bad-faith actors (the main goal of the mod team); it&rsquo;s hard to <em>prevent</em> someone from deciding to harass someone else. But for dealing with disruptive buildups, we kind o need something different.</p>

<h2>Participation guidelines</h2>

<p>Part of the solution here is recognizing that spaces for official discussion are <em>different</em> from community hangout spaces. Our code of conduct attempts to handle abrasive behavior, which can disrupt discussions anywhere, but the comments that can disrupt consensusbuilding official discussions aren&rsquo;t really covered. Nor are the repercussions of code of conduct violations really <em>appropriate</em> for such disruptive comments anyway.</p>

<p>A proposal I&rsquo;ve circulated in the past is to have a notion of participation guidelines. Discussions in team spaces (RFCs, pre-RFCs, discord/zulip/IRC channels during team meetings) follow a set of rules set forth by the individual teams. It might be worth having a base set of participation guidelines defined by the core team. Something like the following is a very rough strawman:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have irrelevant discussions during team meetings on Discord/IRC/Zulip</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take threads off topic</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rehash discussions</li>
</ul>


<p>We ask people to read these before participating, but also breaking these rules isn&rsquo;t considered serious, it just triggers a conversation (and maybe the hiding/deletion of a comment). If someone repeatedly breaks these rules they may be asked to not participate in a given thread anymore. The primary goal here is to empower team members to better deal with disruptive comments by giving them a formalized framework. Having codified rules helps team members confidently deal with such situations without having to worry as much about drawing direct ire from affected community members.</p>

<p>A base participation guidelines document can also be a value statement, not just a set of rules but also set of values. These values can be things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We explicitly value high empathy interactions&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How everyone is feeling is everyone&rsquo;s business&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>(h/t <a href="http://twitter.com/adam_n_p/">Adam</a> for the articulate wording here)</p>

<p>Having such words written somewhere &mdash; both the high level values we expect people to hold, and the individual behaviors we expect people to exhibit (or not exhibit) &mdash; is really valuable in and of itself, even if not enforced. The value of such documents is not that everyone reads them before participating &mdash; most don&rsquo;t &mdash; but they serve as a good starting point for people interested in learning how to best conduct themselves, as well as an easy place to point people to where they&rsquo;re having trouble doing so.</p>

<p>On its own, I find that this is a powerful framework but may not achieve the goal of improving the situation. I recently realized that this actually couples really well with a <em>different</em> idea I&rsquo;ve been talking about for quite a while now, the idea of having facilitators:</p>

<h2>Facilitators</h2>

<p>A common conflict I see occurring is that in many cases it&rsquo;s a team&rsquo;s job to think about and opine on a technical decision, but it&rsquo;s also the team&rsquo;s job to shepherd the discussion for that decision. This often works out great, but it also leads to people just feeling unheard. It kinda hurts when someone who has just strongly disagreed with you goes on to summarize the state of the discussion in a way that you feel you&rsquo;ve been unfairly represented. The natural response to that for most people isn&rsquo;t to work with that person and try to be properly represented, it&rsquo;s to just get angry, leading to less empathy over time.</p>

<p>By design, Rust team members are <em>partisan</em>. The teams exist to build well-informed, carefully crafted opinions, and present them to the community. They also exist to make final decisions based on the results of a consensusbuilding discussion, which can involve picking sides. This is fine, there is always going to be some degree of partisanship amongst decisionmakers, or decisions would not get made.</p>

<p>Having team members also facilitate discussions is somewhat at odds with all of this. Furthermore, I feel like they don&rsquo;t have enough bandwidth to do this well anyway. Some teams do have a concept of &ldquo;sheriffs&rdquo;, but this is more of an onramp to full team membership and the role of a sheriff is largely the same as the role of a team member, just without a binding vote.</p>

<p>I feel like it would be useful to have a group of (per-team?) <em>facilitators</em> to help with this. Facilitators are people who are interested in seeing progress happening, and largely don&rsquo;t have <em>much</em> of an opinion on a given discussion, or are able to set aside this opinion in the interest of moving a discussion forward. They operate largely at the meta level of the discussion. Actions they may take are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Summarizing the discussion every now and then</li>
<li>Calling out one sided discussions</li>
<li>Encouraging one-on-one tangents to be discussed elsewhere (perhaps creating a space for them, like an issue)</li>
<li>Calling out specific people to do a thing that helps move the discussion forward. For example, something like &ldquo;hey @Manishearth, I noticed you&rsquo;ve been vocal in <a href="https://github.com/mystor/slag">arguing that Rust should switch to whitespace-sensitive syntax</a>, could you summarize all the arguments made by people on your side?&rdquo; would help.</li>
<li>Reinforcing positive behavior</li>
<li>Attempting to identify the root cause of a disagreement, or empowering people to work together to identify this. This one is important but tricky. I&rsquo;ve often enjoyed doing it &mdash; noticing the core axiomatic disagreement at play and spelling it out is a great feeling. But I&rsquo;ve also found that it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to do when you&rsquo;re emotionally involved, and I&rsquo;ve often needed a nudge from someone else to get there.</li>
</ul>


<p>At a high level, the job of the facilitators is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>help foster empathy between participants</li>
<li>help linearize complex discussions</li>
<li>nudge towards cooperative behavior, away from adversarial behavior. Get people playing not to win, but to win-win.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that facilitators don&rsquo;t make decisions &mdash; the team does. In fact, they almost completely avoid making technical points, they instead keep their comments largely at the meta level, perhaps occasionally making factual corrections.</p>

<p>The teams <em>could</em> do most of this themselves<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, but as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before it&rsquo;s harder for others to not perceive all of your actions as partisan when some of them are. Furthermore, it can come off as patronizing at times.</p>

<p>This is also something the moderation team could do, however it&rsquo;s <em>much</em> harder to scale the moderation team this way. Given that the moderation team deals with harassment and stuff like that, we need to be careful about how we build it up. On the other hand facilitating discussions is largely a public task, and the stakes aren&rsquo;t as high: screwups can get noticed, and they don&rsquo;t cause much harm. As a fundamentally <em>proactive</em> moderation effort, most actions taken will be to nudge things in a positive direction; getting this wrong usually just means that the status quo is maintained, not that harm is caused. Also, from talking to people it seems that while very few people want to be involved in moderating Rust, this notion of <em>facilitating</em> sounds much more fun and rewarding (I&rsquo;d love to hear from people who would like to help).</p>

<p>And to me, this pairs really well with the idea of participation guidelines: teams can write down how they want discussions to take place on their venues, and facilitators can help ensure this works out. It&rsquo;s good to look at the participation guidelines less as a set of rules and more as an aspiration for how we conduct ourselves, with the facilitators as a means to achieving that goal.</p>

<p>There are a lot of specifics we can twiddle with this proposal. For example, we can have a per-team group of appointed facilitators (with no overlap with the team), and for a given discussion one facilitator is picked (if they don&rsquo;t have time or feel like they have strong opinions, try someone else). But there&rsquo;s also no strong need for there to be such a group, facilitators can be picked as a discussion is starting, too. I don&rsquo;t expect <em>most</em> discussions to need facilitators, so this is mostly reserved for discussions we expect will get heated, or discussions that have started to get heated. I&rsquo;m not really going to spend time analysing these specifics; I have opinions but I&rsquo;d rather have us figure out if we want to do something like this and how before getting into the weeds.</p>

<h2>Prospective outcomes</h2>

<p>The real goal here is to bootstrap better empathy within the community. In an ideal world we don&rsquo;t need facilitators, instead everyone is able to facilitate well. The explicitly non-partisan nature of facilitators is <em>useful</em>, but if everyone was able to operate in this manner it would largely be unnecessary. But as with any organization, being able to horizontally scale specific skills is really tricky without specialization.</p>

<p>I suspect that in the process of building up such a team of facilitators, we will also end up building a set of resources that can help others learn to act the same way, and eventually overall improve how empathetic our community is.</p>

<p>The concept of facilitators directly addresses the moderation problem, but it also handles the scaling problem pretty well! Facilitators are key in re-linearizing the n-to-n discussions, bringing the &ldquo;parallel universes&rdquo; together again. This should overall help people (especially team members) who are feeling overwhelmed by all the things that are going on.</p>

<p>This also helps with concerns people have that they&rsquo;re not getting heard, as facilitators are basically posed as allies on all sides of the argument; people whose primary goal is to <em>help communication happen</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall what I&rsquo;ve proposed here isn&rsquo;t a fully-formed idea; but it&rsquo;s the seed of one. There are a lot of interesting bits to discuss and build upon. I&rsquo;m hoping through this post we might push forward some of the discussions about governance &mdash; both by providing a strawman idea, as well as by providing a perspective on the problem that I hope is useful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really interested to hear what people think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>See also: <a href="https://myrrlyn.net/blog/misc/to-all-the-posts-ive-blogged-before">Alex&rsquo;s version of this blog post</a></em></p>

<p>I started this blog three years ago, moving from my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.com/">older blog</a>, hoping to written about programming, math, physics, books, and miscellenia. I&rsquo;ve not quite written about everything I wanted to, but I&rsquo;ve been very very happy with the experience of blogging. <code>wc</code> says I&rsquo;ve written almost 75k words, which is mind-boggling to me!</p>

<p>I often get asked by others &mdash; usually trying to decide if they should start blogging &mdash; what it&rsquo;s like. I also often try to convince friends to blog by enumerating why I think it&rsquo;s awesome. Might as well write it down so that it&rsquo;s generally useful for everyone! 😃</p>

<h2>Blogging helps cement my understanding of things!</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often noticed that I&rsquo;ll start blogging about something I <em>think</em> I understand, and it turns out that my understanding of the subject was somewhat nebulous. Turns out it&rsquo;s pretty easy to convince ourselves that we understand something.</p>

<p>The act of writing stuff down helps cement my own understanding &mdash; words are usually not as nebulous as thoughts so I&rsquo;m forced to figure out little details.</p>

<p>I recall when I wrote my post on <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/30/how-rust-achieves-thread-safety/">how Rust&rsquo;s thread safety guarantees work</a>, I <em>thought</em> I understood <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> in Rust. I understood what they did, but I didn&rsquo;t have a clear mental model for them. I obtained this mental model through the process of writing the post; to be able to explain it to others I had to first explain it to myself.</p>

<p>I point out this post in particular because this was both one of the first posts for me where I&rsquo;d noticed this, and, more importantly, my more concrete mental model led to me <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25894">finding a soundness bug in Rust&rsquo;s standard library</a>. When I was thinking about my mental model I realized &ldquo;an impl that looks like this should never exist&rdquo;,
so I grepped the source code and found one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve even noticed a difference between one-on-one explaining and explaining things through blog posts. I <em>love</em> explaining things one-on-one, it&rsquo;s much easier to tailor the explanation to the other person&rsquo;s background,
as well as what they&rsquo;re actually asking for help with. Plus, it&rsquo;s interactive. A <em>lot</em> of my posts are of the &ldquo;okay I get this question a lot I&rsquo;m going to write down the answer so I don&rsquo;t have to repeat myself&rdquo; kind and I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ve often learned things from these despite having talked about the thing in the article contents multiple times.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s basically that blogging is inherently one-many &mdash; you&rsquo;re trying to explain to a whole group of people with varied backgrounds &mdash; which means you need to cover all your bases<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and explain everything together instead of the minimum necessary.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s really fun to revisit old posts!</h2>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll admit that I never really write blog posts with this in mind. But when I <em>do</em> reread them, I&rsquo;m usually quite thankful I wrote them!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of rereading in general, I&rsquo;ve reread most of my favorite books tens of times; I make a yearly pilgrimage to <a href="https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens">James Mickens&#8217; website</a>; I reread many of my favorite posts and articles on the internet; and I often reread my <em>own</em> posts from the past.</p>

<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do it because I want a refresher in a topic. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do it because I&rsquo;m bored. Whatever the reason, it&rsquo;s always been a useful and fun thing to do.</p>

<p>Rereading old posts is a great way to transport myself back to my mindset from when I wrote the post. It&rsquo;s easy to see progress in my understanding of things as well as in my writing. It&rsquo;s interesting to note what I thought super important to include in the post <em>then</em> that I consider totally obvious <em>now</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s interesting to relearn what I&rsquo;ve forgotten. It&rsquo;s reassuring to realize that my terrible jokes were just as terrible as they are now.</p>

<p>One of my favorite posts to reread is <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/exploring-zero-knowledge-proofs/">this really long one on generalized zero knowledge proofs</a>. It&rsquo;s the longest post I&rsquo;ve written so far<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and it&rsquo;s on a topic I don&rsquo;t deal with often &mdash; cryptography. Not only does it help put me back in a mindset for thinking about cryptography, it&rsquo;s about something super interesting but also complicated enough that rereading the post is like learning it all over again.</p>

<h2>It lets me exercise a different headspace!</h2>

<p>I like programming a lot, but if programming was <em>all</em> I did, I&rsquo;d get tired pretty quickly. When I was a student learning physics I&rsquo;d often contribute to open source in my spare time, but now I write code full time so I&rsquo;m less inclined to do it in my free time<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But I still sometimes feel like doing programmery things in my spare time just &hellip; not programming.</p>

<p>Turns out that blogging doesn&rsquo;t tire me out the same way! I&rsquo;m sure that if I spent the whole day writing I&rsquo;d not want to write when I go home, but I don&rsquo;t spend the whole day writing, so it&rsquo;s all good. It&rsquo;s refreshing to sit down to write a blog post and discover a fresh reserve of energy. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the right term, but I usually call this &ldquo;using a different headspace&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also started using this to plan my work, I mix up the kinds of headspace I&rsquo;m employing for various tasks so that I feel energetic throughout the day.</p>

<p>This is also why I really enjoy mentoring &mdash; mentoring often requires the same effort from me as fixing it myself, but it&rsquo;s a different headspace I&rsquo;m employing so it&rsquo;s less tiring.</p>

<h2>Blogging lets me be lazy!</h2>

<p>I often find myself explaining things often. I like helping folks and explaining things, but I&rsquo;m also lazy<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, so writing stuff down really makes stuff easy for me! If folks ask me a question I can give a quick answer and then go &ldquo;if you want to learn more, I&rsquo;ve written about it here!&rdquo;. If folks are asking a question a lot, there&rsquo;s probably something missing in the documentation or learning materials about it. Some things can be fixed upstream in documentation, but other things &mdash; like <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/05/14/mentally-modelling-modules/">&ldquo;how should I reason about modules in Rust?&rdquo;</a> deserve to be tackled as a separate problem and addressed with their own post.</p>

<p>(Yes, this post is in this category!)</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s okay if folks have written about it before!</h2>

<p>A common question I&rsquo;ve gotten is &ldquo;Well I can write about X but &hellip; there are a lot of other posts out there about it, should I still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes!!</p>

<p>People think differently, people learn differently, and people come from different backgrounds. Existing posts may be useful for some folks but less useful for others.</p>

<p>My personal rule of thumb is that if it took <em>me</em> some effort to understand something after reading about it, that&rsquo;s something worth writing about, so it&rsquo;s easier to understand for others like me encountering the subject.</p>

<p>One of my favorite bloggers, <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> very often writes posts explaining computer concepts. Most of the times these have been explained before in other blog posts or manuals. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter &mdash; her posts are <em>different</em>, and they&rsquo;re <em>amazing</em>. They&rsquo;re upbeat, fun to read, and often get me excited to learn more about things I knew about but never really looked at closely before.</p>

<h2>I kinda feel it&rsquo;s my duty to?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a quote by Toni Morrison I quite enjoy:</p>

<blockquote><p>I tell my students, &lsquo;When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game.</p></blockquote>

<p>I enjoy it so much I <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/rustfest-slides/#/13">concluded my talk at RustFest Kyiv with it</a>!</p>

<p>I have the privilege of having time to do things like blogging and mentoring. Given that, I feel that it really is my duty to share what I know as much as possible; to help others attempting to tread the path I&rsquo;m treading; and to battle against tribal knowledge.</p>

<p>When it comes to programming I&rsquo;m mostly &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo;. But when I say that, I really mean that I wasn&rsquo;t taught in a traditional way by other humans &mdash; I learned things by trying stuff out and <em>reading what others had written</em>. I didn&rsquo;t learn Rust by taking <code>rustc</code> and pretending to be a fuzzer and just trying random nonsense till stuff made sense, I went through the tutorial (and <em>then</em> started exploring by trying random stuff). I didn&rsquo;t figure out cool algorithms by discovering them from first principles, I picked them up from books and blog posts. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; because I&rsquo;ve been in charge of my learning process, but I&rsquo;ve definitely relied on the work of other people throughout this process.</p>

<p>This means that for me, personally, knowledge-sharing is especially important. If I had to spend time figuring something out, I should make it easier for the next people to try<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>(All this said, I probably don&rsquo;t blog as much as I <em>should</em>)</p>

<h2>You should blog too!</h2>

<p>I wish everyone wrote more. I know not everyone has the time/privilege to do this, but if you do, I urge you to start!</p>

<p>I feel like tips on <em>how</em> to blog would fill up an entire other blog post, but Julia Evans has <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts//">multiple</a> <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/20/blogging-principles/">posts</a> on this that I strongly recommend. Feel free to ask me for review on posts!</p>

<p>As for the technicalities of setting up a blog, my colleague Emily recently <a href="https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2018/07/27/myo-website.html">wrote a great post about doing this with Jekyll</a>. This blog uses <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> which is similar to set up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;ve recently been making lots of progress on future plans for <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy">clippy</a> and I
thought I&rsquo;d post an update.</p>

<p>For some background, Clippy is the linter for Rust. We have more than 250 lints, and
are steadily growing.</p>

<h2>Clippy and Nightly</h2>

<p>Sadly, Clippy has been nightly-only for a very long time. The reason behind this is
that to perform its analyses it hooks into the compiler so that it doesn&rsquo;t have to
reimplement half the compiler&rsquo;s info to get things like type information. But
these are internal APIs and as such will never stabilize, so Clippy needs to be
used with nightly Rust.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re hoping this will change soon! The plan is that Clippy will eventually
be distributed by Rustup, so something like <code>rustup component add clippy</code> will
get you the clippy binary.</p>

<p>The first steps are <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51122">happening</a>, we&rsquo;re planning on setting it up so that when it compiles
Rustup will be able to fetch a clippy component (however this won&rsquo;t be the recommended way
to use clippy until we figure out the workflow here, so sit tight!)</p>

<p>Eventually, clippy will probably block nightlies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; and after a bunch of cycles of letting that
work itself out, hopefully clippy will be available with the stable compiler. There&rsquo;s a lot of
stuff that needs to be figured out, and we want to do this in a way that minimally impacts
compiler development, so this may move in fits and starts.</p>

<h2>Lint audit</h2>

<p>A couple months ago <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">Oliver</a> and I<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> did a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/pull/2579">lint audit</a> in Clippy. Previously,
clippy lints were classified as simply &ldquo;clippy&rdquo;, &ldquo;clippy_pedantic&rdquo;, and &ldquo;restriction&rdquo;.
&ldquo;restriction&rdquo; was for allow-by-default lints for things which are generally not a problem but may
be something you specifically want to forbid based on the situation, and &ldquo;pedantic&rdquo;
was for all the lints which were allow-by-default for other reasons.</p>

<p>Usually these reasons included stuff like &ldquo;somewhat controversial lint&rdquo;, &ldquo;lint is very buggy&rdquo;,
or for lints which are actually exceedingly pedantic and may only be wanted by folks
who very seriously prefer their code to be <em>perfect</em>.</p>

<p>We had a lot of buggy lints, and these categories weren&rsquo;t as helpful. People use clippy
for different reasons. Some folks only care about clippy catching bugs, whereas others want
its help enforcing the general &ldquo;Rust Style&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So we came up with a better division of lints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Correctness (Deny): Probable bugs, e.g. calling <code>.clone()</code> on <code>&amp;&amp;T</code>, which clones the (<code>Copy</code>) reference and not the actual type</li>
<li>Style (Warn): Style issues; where the fix usually doesn&rsquo;t semantically change the code. For example, having a method named <code>into_foo()</code> that doesn&rsquo;t take <code>self</code> by-move</li>
<li>Complexity (Warn): For detecting unnecessary code complexities and helping simplify them. For example, replacing <code>.filter(..).next()</code> with <code>.find(..)</code></li>
<li>Perf (Warn): Detecting potential performance footguns, like using <code>Box&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or calling <code>.or(foo())</code> instead of <code>or_else(foo)</code>.</li>
<li>Pedantic (Allow): Controversial or exceedingly pedantic lints</li>
<li>Nursery (Allow): For lints which are buggy or need more work</li>
<li>Cargo (Allow): Lints about your Cargo setup</li>
<li>Restriction (Allow): Lints for things which are not usually a problem, but may be something specific situations may dictate disallowing.</li>
</ul>


<p>and applied it to the codebase. You can see the results on our <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html">lint list</a></p>

<p>Some lints could belong in more than one group, and we picked the best one in that case. Feedback welcome!</p>

<h2>Clippy 1.0</h2>

<p>In the run up to making Clippy a rustup component we&rsquo;d like to do a 1.0 release of Clippy. This involves an RFC,
and pinning down an idea of stability.</p>

<p>The general plan we have right now is to have the same idea of lint stability as rustc; essentially
we do not guarantee stability under <code>#[deny(lintname)]</code>. This is mostly fine since <code>deny</code> only affects
the current crate (dependencies have their lints capped) so at most you&rsquo;ll be forced to slap on an <code>allow</code>
somewhere after a rustup.</p>

<p>With specifics, this means that we&rsquo;ll never remove lints. We may recategorize them, or &ldquo;deprecate&rdquo; them
(which makes the lint do nothing, but keeps the name around so that <code>#[allow(lintname)]</code> doesn&rsquo;t break the build
aside from emitting a warning).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also not change what individual lints do fundamentally. The kinds of changes you can expect are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entirely new lints</li>
<li>Fixing false positives (a lint may no longer lint in a buggy case)</li>
<li>Fixing false negatives (A case where the lint <em>should</em> be linting but doesn&rsquo;t is fixed)</li>
<li>Bugfixes (When the lint panics or does something otherwise totally broken)</li>
</ul>


<p>When fixing false negatives this will usually be fixing things that can be understood as comfortably within the
scope of the lint as documented/named</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting an RFC soonish that both contains this general plan of stability, as well as a list of the current
lint categorization for folks to discuss.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, thought I&rsquo;d just post a general update on everything, since stuff&rsquo;s changing quickly.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still time for stable or even just reliably rustuppable nightly clippy to happen but the path to it is pretty clear now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I fell down a rather interesting rabbit hole in Rust, which was basically
me discovering a series of quirks of the Rust compiler/language, each one leading to the
next when I asked &ldquo;why?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It started when someone asked why autogenerated <code>Debug</code> impls use argument names like <code>__arg_0</code>
which start with a double underscore.</p>

<p>This happened to be <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32294">my fault</a>. The reason <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32251#issuecomment-197481726">we used a double underscore</a> was that
while a single underscore tells rustc not to warn about a possibly-unused variable, there&rsquo;s an off-
by-default clippy lint that warns about variables that start with a single underscore that are used,
which can be silenced with a double underscore. Now, the correct fix here is to make the lint ignore
derive/macros (which I believe we did as well), but at the time we needed to add an underscore
anyway so a double underscore didn&rsquo;t seem worse.</p>

<p>Except of course, this double underscore appears in the docs. Oops.</p>

<p>Ideally the rustc derive infrastructure would have a way of specifying the argument name to use so
that we can at least have descriptive things here, but that&rsquo;s a bit more work (I&rsquo;m willing to mentor
this work though!). So I thought I&rsquo;d fix this by at least removing the double underscore, and making
the unused lint ignore <code>#[derive()]</code> output.</p>

<p>While going through the code to look for underscores I also discovered a hygiene issue. The following code
throws a bunch of very weird type errors:</p>

<p><code>__cmp</code> can both be a binding to a wildcard pattern match as well as a match against a constant
named <code>__cmp</code>, and in the presence of such a constant it resolves to the constant, causing
type errors.</p>

<p>One way to fix this is to bind <code>foo.cmp(bar)</code> to some temporary variable <code>x</code> and use that directly in
a <code>_ =&gt; x</code> branch.</p>

<p>I thought I could be clever and try <code>cmp @ _ =&gt; cmp</code> instead. <code>match</code> supports syntax where you can
do <code>foo @ &lt;pattern&gt;</code>, where <code>foo</code> is bound to the entire matched variable. The <code>cmp</code> here is unambiguously
a binding; it cannot be a pattern. So no conflicting with the <code>const</code>, problem solved!</p>

<p>So I made <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49676">a PR for both removing the underscores and also fixing this</a>. The change for <code>__cmp</code>
is no longer in that PR, but you can find it <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/commit/partial-cmp-hygiene">here</a>.</p>

<p>Huh. Wat. Why? <code>cmp @ _</code> seems to be pretty unambiguous, what&rsquo;s wrong with it shadowing a constant?</p>

<p>Turns out bindings cannot shadow constants at all, for a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33118#issuecomment-233962221">rather subtle reason</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">@</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">...;</span> <span class="c1">// A_let</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">match</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">...;</span> <span class="c1">// A_match</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What happens here is that constants and variables occupy the same namespace. So <code>A_let</code> shadows
<code>A_const</code> here, and when we attempt to <code>match</code>, <code>A_match</code> is resolved to <code>A_let</code> and rejected (since
you can&rsquo;t match against a variable), and <code>A_match</code> falls back to resolving as a fresh binding
pattern, instead of resolving to a pattern that matches against <code>A_const</code>.</p>

<p>This is kinda weird, so we disallow shadowing constants with variables. This is rarely a problem
because variables are lowercase and constants are uppercase. We could <em>technically</em> allow this
language-wise, but it&rsquo;s hard on the implementation (and irrelevant in practice) so we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<hr />

<p>So I dropped that fix. The temporary local variable approach is broken as well since
you can also name a constant the same as the local variable and have a clash (so again, you
need the underscores to avoid surprises).</p>

<p>But then I realized that we had an issue with removing the underscores from <code>__arg_0</code> as well.</p>

<p>This breakage is not an issue with the current code because of the double underscores &ndash; there&rsquo;s a
very low chance someone will create a constant that is both lowercase and starts with a double
underscore. But it&rsquo;s a problem when I remove the underscores since that chance shoots up.</p>

<p>Anyway, this failure is even weirder. Why are we attempting to match against the constant in the
first place? <code>fn</code> argument patterns<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are irrefutable, i.e. all possible values of the type should match
the argument. For example, <code>fn foo(Some(foo): Option&lt;u8&gt;) {}</code> will fail to compile with
&ldquo;refutable pattern in function argument: <code>None</code> not covered&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no point trying to match against constants here; because even if we find a constant it will be rejected
later. Instead, we can unambiguously resolve identifiers as new bindings, yes?</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Firm in my belief, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49680">I filed an issue</a>.</p>

<p>I was wrong, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49680#issuecomment-379029404">not going to always be rejected later</a>. With zero-sized types this
can totally still work:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here because <code>S</code> has only one state, matching against a constant of the type is still irrefutable.</p>

<p>I argued that this doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; since the type has a single value, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we resolved to
a new binding or the constant; the value and semantics are the same.</p>

<p>This is true.</p>

<p>Except.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49680#issuecomment-379032842">Except for when destructors come in</a>.</p>

<p>It was at this point that my table found itself in the perplexing state of being upside-down.</p>

<p>This is still really fine, zero-sized-constants-with-destructors is a pretty rare thing in Rust
and I don&rsquo;t really see folks <em>relying</em> on this behavior.</p>

<p>However I later realized that this entire detour was pointless because even if we fix this, we end up
with a way for bindings to shadow constants. Which &hellip; which we already realized isn&rsquo;t allowed by the
compiler till we fix some bugs.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <em>actual</em> fix to the macro stuff is to use hygenic generated variable names, which the current
infrastructure supports. I plan to make a PR for this eventually.</p>

<p>But it was a very interesting dive into the nuances of pattern matching in Rust.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17015654/apple-iphone-crash-ios-11-bug-imessage">yet another iOS text crash</a>, where just looking at a particular string crashes
iOS. Basically, if you put this string in any system text box (and other places), it crashes that
process. I&rsquo;ve been testing it by copy-pasting characters into Spotlight so I don&rsquo;t end up crashing
my browser.</p>

<p>The original sequence is U+0C1C U+0C4D U+0C1E U+200C U+0C3E, which is a sequence of Telugu
characters: the consonant ja (జ), a virama (&#8239;్&#8239;), the consonant nya (ఞ), a zero-width non-joiner, and
the vowel aa (&#8239;ా).</p>

<p>I was pretty interested in what made this sequence &ldquo;special&rdquo;, and started investigating.</p>

<p>So first when looking into this, I thought that the &lt;ja, virama, nya&gt; sequence was the culprit.
That sequence forms a special ligature in many Indic scripts (ज्ञ in Devanagari) which is often
considered a letter of its own. However, the ligature for Telugu doesn&rsquo;t seem very &ldquo;special&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Also, from some experimentation, this bug seemed to occur for <em>any</em> pair of Telugu consonants with
a vowel, as long as the vowel is not &nbsp;&#8239;ై (ai). Huh.</p>

<p>The ZWNJ must be doing something weird, then. &lt;consonant, virama, consonant, vowel&gt; is a
pretty common sequence in any Indic script; but ZWNJ before a vowel isn&rsquo;t very useful for most
scripts (except for Bengali and Oriya, but I&rsquo;ll get to that).</p>

<p>And then I saw that <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeUnicode/status/963300865762254848">there was a sequence in Bengali</a> that also crashed.</p>

<p>The sequence is U+09B8 U+09CD U+09B0 U+200C U+09C1, which is the consonant &ldquo;so&rdquo; (স), a virama (&#8239;্&#8239;),
the consonant &ldquo;ro&rdquo; (র), a ZWNJ, and vowel u (&nbsp;&#8239;ু).</p>

<p>Before we get too into this, let&rsquo;s first take a little detour to learn how Indic scripts work:</p>

<h2>Indic scripts and consonant clusters</h2>

<p>Indic scripts are <em>abugidas</em>; which means that their &ldquo;letters&rdquo; are consonants, which you
can attach diacritics to to change the vowel. By default, consonants have a base vowel.
So, for example, क is &ldquo;kuh&rdquo; (kə, often transcribed as &ldquo;ka&rdquo;), but I can change the vowel to make it के
(the &ldquo;ka&rdquo; in &ldquo;okay&rdquo;) का (&ldquo;kaa&rdquo;, like &ldquo;car&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Usually, the default vowel is the ə sound, though not always (in Bengali it&rsquo;s more of an o sound).</p>

<p>Because of the &ldquo;default&rdquo; vowel, you need a way to combine consonants. For example, if you wished to
write the word &ldquo;ski&rdquo;, you can&rsquo;t write it as स + की (sa + ki = &ldquo;saki&rdquo;), you must write it as स्की.
What&rsquo;s happened here is that the स got its vowel &ldquo;killed&rdquo;, and got tacked on to the की to form a
consonant cluster ligature.</p>

<p>You can <em>also</em> write this as स्&zwnj;की . That little tail you see on the स is known as a &ldquo;virama&rdquo;;
it basically means &ldquo;remove this vowel&rdquo;. Explicit viramas are sometimes used when there&rsquo;s no easy way
to form a ligature, e.g. in ङ्&zwnj;ठ because there is no simple way to ligatureify ङ into ठ. Some scripts
also <em>prefer</em> explicit viramas, e.g. &ldquo;ski&rdquo; in Malayalam is written as സ്കീ, where the little crescent
is the explicit virama.</p>

<p>In unicode, the virama character is always used to form a consonant cluster. So स्की was written as
&lt;स, &#8239;्, क, &#8239;ी&gt;, or &lt;sa, virama, ka, i&gt;. If the font supports the cluster, it will show up
as a ligature, otherwise it will use an explicit virama.</p>

<p>For Devanagari and Bengali, <em>usually</em>, in a consonant cluster the first consonant is munged a bit and the second consonant stays intact.
There are exceptions &ndash; sometimes they&rsquo;ll form an entirely new glyph (क + ष = क्ष), and sometimes both
glyphs will change (ड + ड = ड्ड, द + म = द्म, द + ब = द्ब). Those last ones should look like this in conjunct form:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/unicode-crash/conjuncts.png" width="200"></p>

<h2>Investigating the Bengali case</h2>

<p>Now, interestingly, unlike the Telugu crash, the Bengali crash seemed to only occur when the second
consonant is র (&ldquo;ro&rdquo;). However, I can trigger it for any choice of the first consonant or vowel, except
when the vowel is &#8239;ো (o) or &#8239;ৌ (au).</p>

<p>Now, র is an interesting consonant in some Indic scripts, including Devanagari. In Devanagari,
it looks like र (&ldquo;ra&rdquo;). However, it does all kinds of things when forming a cluster. If you&rsquo;re having it
precede another consonant in a cluster, it forms a little feather-like stroke, like in र्क (rka). In Marathi,
that stroke can also look like a tusk, as in र्&zwj;क. As a suffix consonant, it can provide a little
&ldquo;extra leg&rdquo;, as in क्र (kra). For letters without a vertical stroke, like ठ (tha), it does this caret-like thing,
ठ्र (thra).</p>

<p>Basically, while most consonants retain some of their form when put inside a cluster, र does not. And
a more special thing about र is that this happens even when र is the <em>second</em> consonant in a cluster &ndash; as I mentioned
before, for most consonant clusters the second consonant stays intact. While there are exceptions, they are usually
specific to the cluster; it is only र for which this happens for all clusters.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s similar in Bengali, র as the second consonant adds a tentacle-like thing on the existing consonant. For example,
প + র (po + ro) gives প্র (pro).</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just র that does this in Bengali, the consonant &ldquo;jo&rdquo; does as well. প + য (po + jo) forms প্য (pjo),
and the য is transformed into a wavy line called a &ldquo;jophola&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So I tried it with য  &mdash; , and it turns out that the Bengali crash occurs for  য as well!
So the general Bengali case is &lt;consonant, virama, র OR য, ZWNJ, vowel&gt;, where the vowel is not  &#8239;ো or &#8239;ৌ.</p>

<h2>Suffix-joining consonants</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;re getting close, here. At least for Bengali, it occurs when the second consonant is such that it often
combines with the first consonant without modifying its form much.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the case for Telugu as well! Consonant clusters in Telugu are usually formed by preserving the
original consonant, and tacking the second consonant on below!</p>

<p>For example, the original crashy string contains the cluster జ + ఞ, which looks like జ్ఞ. The first letter isn&rsquo;t
really modified, but the second is.</p>

<p>From this, we can guess that it will also occur for Devanagari with र. Indeed it does! U+0915 U+094D U+0930 U+200C U+093E, that is,
&lt;क, &#8239;्, र, zwnj, &#8239;ा&gt; (&lt; ka, virama, ra, zwnj, aa &gt;) is one such crashing sequence.</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t really the whole story, is it? For example, the crash does occur for &ldquo;kro&rdquo; + zwnj + vowel in Bengali,
and in &ldquo;kro&rdquo; (ক্র = ক + র = ko + ro) the resultant cluster involves the munging of both the prefix and suffix. But
the crash doesn&rsquo;t occur for द्ब or ड्ड. It seems to be specific to the letter, not the nature of the cluster.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, the reason is that for many fonts (presumably the ones in use), these consonants
form &ldquo;suffix joining consonants&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (a term I made up) when preceded by a virama. This seems to
correspond to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/features_pt#tag-pstf"><code>pstf</code> OpenType feature</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/features_uz#vatu"><code>vatu</code></a>.</p>

<p>For example, the sequence virama + क gives &nbsp;&#8239;्क, i.e. it renders a virama with a placeholder followed by a क.</p>

<p>But, for र, virama + र renders &#8239;्र, which for me looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-ra.png" width="200"></p>

<p>In fact, this is the case for the other consonants as well. For me, &#8239;्र &#8239;্র &#8239;্য &#8239;్ఞ &#8239;్క
(Devanagari virama-ra, Bengali virama-ro, Bengali virama-jo, Telugu virama-nya, Telugu virama-ka)
all render as &ldquo;suffix joining consonants&rdquo;:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-consonant.png" width="200"></p>

<p>(This is true for all Telugu consonants, not just the ones listed).</p>

<p>An interesting bit is that the crash does not occur for &lt;र, virama, र, zwnj, vowel&gt;, because र-virama-र
uses the prefix-joining form of the first र (र्र). The same occurs for র with itself or ৰ or য. Because the virama
is &ldquo;stickier&rdquo; to the left in these cases, it doesn&rsquo;t cause a crash. (h/t <a href="https://github.com/hackbunny">hackbunny</a> for discovering this
using a <a href="https://github.com/hackbunny/viramarama">script</a> to enumerate all cases).</p>

<p>Kannada <em>also</em> has &ldquo;suffix joining consonants&rdquo;, but for some reason I cannot trigger the crash with it. Ya in Gurmukhi
is also suffix-joining.</p>

<h2>The ZWNJ</h2>

<p>The ZWNJ is curious. The crash doesn&rsquo;t happen without it, but as I mentioned before a ZWNJ before a vowel
doesn&rsquo;t really <em>do</em> anything for most Indic scripts. In Indic scripts, a ZWNJ can be used to explicitly force a
virama if used after the virama (I used it to write स्&zwnj;की in this post), however that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s being used here.</p>

<p>In Bengali and Oriya specifically, a ZWNJ can be used to force a different vowel form when used before a vowel
(e.g. রু vs র&zwnj;ু), however this bug seems to apply to vowels for which there is only one form, and this bug
also applies to other scripts where this isn&rsquo;t the case anyway.</p>

<p>The exception vowels are interesting. They&rsquo;re basically all vowels that are made up of <em>two</em> glyph components. Philippe Verdy
points out:</p>

<blockquote><p>And why this bug does not occur with some vowels is because these are vowels in two parts,
that are first decomposed into two separate glyphs reordered in the buffer of glyphs, while
other vowels do not need this prior mapping and keep their initial direct mapping from their
codepoints in fonts, which means that this has to do to the way the ZWNJ looks for the glyphs
of the vowels in the glyphs buffer and not in the initial codepoints buffer: there&rsquo;s some desynchronization,
and more probably an uninitialized data field (for the lookup made in handling ZWNJ) if no vowel decomposition was done
(the same data field is correctly initialized when it is the first consonnant which takes an alternate form before
a virama, like in most Indic consonnant clusters, because the a glyph buffer is created.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Generalizing</h2>

<p>So, ultimately, the full set of cases that cause the crash are:</p>

<p>Any sequence <code>&lt;consonant1, virama, consonant2, ZWNJ, vowel&gt;</code> in Devanagari, Bengali, and Telugu, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>consonant2</code> is suffix-joining (<code>pstf</code>/<code>vatu</code>) &ndash; i.e. र, র, য, ৰ, and all Telugu consonants</li>
<li><code>consonant1</code> is not a reph-forming letter like र/র (or a variant, like ৰ)</li>
<li><code>vowel</code> does not have two glyph components, i.e. it is not &nbsp;&#8239;ై, &nbsp;&#8239;ো, or &nbsp;&#8239;ৌ</li>
</ul>


<p>This leaves one question open:</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it apply to Kannada? Or, for that matter, Khmer, which has a similar virama-like thing called a &ldquo;coeng&rdquo;?</p>

<h2>Are these valid strings?</h2>

<p>A recurring question I&rsquo;m getting is if these strings are valid in the language, or unicode gibberish
like Zalgo text. Breaking it down:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the <em>rendered</em> glyphs are valid. The original Telugu one is the root of the word for
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; (and I&rsquo;ve taken to calling this bug &ldquo;forbidden knowledge&rdquo; for that reason).</li>
<li>In Telugu and Devanagari, there is no functional use of the ZWNJ as used before a vowel. It
should not be there, and one would not expect it in typical text.</li>
<li>In Bengali (also Oriya), putting a ZWNJ before some vowels prevents them from ligatureifying, and this is
mentioned in the Unicode spec. However, it seems rare for native speakers to use this.</li>
<li>In all of these scripts, putting a ZWNJ after viramas can be used to force an explicit virama
over a ligature. That is not the position ZWNJ is used here, but it gives a hint that this
might have been a mistype. Doing this is <em>also</em> rare at least for Devanagari (and I believe
for the other two scripts as well)</li>
<li>Android has an explicit key for ZWNJ on its keyboards for these languages<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, right next to the spacebar. iOS has this as
well on the long-press of the virama key. <em>Very</em> easy to mistype, at least for Android.</li>
</ul>


<p>So while the crashing strings are usually invalid, and when not, very rare, they are easy enough to mistype.</p>

<p>An example by <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeUnicode">@FakeUnicode</a> was the string &ldquo;For/k&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Foŕk&rdquo;, if accents were easier to type). A
slash isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;d normally type there, and the produced string is gibberish, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to type
by accident.</p>

<p>Except of course that the mistake in &ldquo;For/k&rdquo;/&ldquo;Foŕk&rdquo; is visually obvious and would be fixed; this
isn&rsquo;t the case for most of the crashing strings.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really have <em>one</em> guess as to what&rsquo;s going on here &ndash; I&rsquo;d love to see what people think &ndash; but my current
guess is that the &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; of the virama to the left instead of the right confuses the algorithm that handles ZWNJs after
viramas into thinking the ZWNJ applies to the virama (it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a consonant in between), and this leads to some numbers
not matching up and causing a buffer overflow or something. Philippe&rsquo;s diagnosis of the vowel situation matches up with this.</p>

<p>An interesting thing is that I can cause this crash to happen more reliably in browsers by clicking on the string.</p>

<p>Additionally, <em>sometimes</em> it actually renders in spotlight for a split second before crashing; which
means that either the crash isn&rsquo;t deterministic, or it occurs in some process <em>after</em> rendering. I&rsquo;m
not sure what to think of either. Looking at the backtraces, the crash seems to occur in different
places, so it&rsquo;s likely that it&rsquo;s memory corruption that gets uncovered later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if folks have further insight into this.</p>

<p>Update: Philippe on the Unicode mailing list has <a href="https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2018-m02/0103.html">an interesting theory</a></p>

<p><small>Yes, I could attach a debugger to the crashing process and investigate that instead, but that&rsquo;s no fun 😂</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sum types are pretty cool. Just like how a struct is basically &ldquo;This contains one of these <em>and</em> one of these&rdquo;,
a sum type is &ldquo;This contains one of these <em>or</em> one of these&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So for example, the following sum type in Rust:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">Stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">Numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">u32</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or Swift:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='swift'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">numerical</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>would be one where it&rsquo;s either <code>Foo::Stringy</code> (<code>Foo::stringy</code> for swift), containing a <code>String</code>,
<em>or</em> <code>Foo::Numerical</code>, containing an integer.</p>

<p>This can be pretty useful. For example, messages between threads are often of a &ldquo;this or that or that or that&rdquo;
form.</p>

<p>The nice thing is, matching (switching) on these enums is usually <em>exhaustive</em> &ndash; you must list all
the cases (or include a default arm) for your code to compile. This leads to a useful component
of type safety &ndash; if you add a message to your message passing system, you&rsquo;ll know where to update it.</p>

<p>Go doesn&rsquo;t have these. Go <em>does</em> have interfaces, which are dynamically dispatched. The drawback here
is that you do not get the exhaustiveness condition, and consumers of your library can even add further
cases. (And, of course, dynamic dispatch can be slow). You <em>can</em> get exhaustiveness in Go with <a href="https://github.com/haya14busa/gosum">external tools</a>,
but it&rsquo;s preferable to have such things in the language IMO.</p>

<p>Many years ago when I was learning Go I wrote a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2015/02/thoughts-of-rustacean-learning-go.html">blog post</a> about what I liked and disliked
as a Rustacean learning Go. Since then, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot more time with Go, and I&rsquo;ve learned to like each Go design decision that I initially
disliked, <em>except</em> for the lack of sum types. Most of my issues arose from &ldquo;trying to program Rust in Go&rdquo;,
i.e. using idioms that are natural to Rust (or other languages I&rsquo;d used previously). Once I got used to the
programming style, I realized that aside from the lack of sum types I really didn&rsquo;t find much missing
from the language. Perhaps improvements to error handling.</p>

<p>Now, my intention here isn&rsquo;t really to sell sum types. They&rsquo;re somewhat controversial for Go, and
there are good arguments on both sides. You can see one discussion on this topic <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19412">here</a>.
If I were to make a more concrete proposal I&rsquo;d probably try to motivate this in much more depth. But even
I&rsquo;m not very <em>strongly</em> of the opinion that Go needs sum types; I have a slight preference for it.</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m going to try and sketch this proposal for sum types that has been floating around my
mind for a while. I end up mentioning it often and it&rsquo;s nice to have something to link to. Overall,
I think this &ldquo;fits well&rdquo; with the existing Go language design.</p>

<h2>The proposal</h2>

<p>The essence is pretty straightforward: Extend interfaces to allow for &ldquo;closed interfaces&rdquo;. These are
interfaces that are only implemented for a small list of types.</p>

<p>Writing the <code>Foo</code> sum type above would be:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">SomeFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">OtherFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even need to have functions defined on it.</p>

<p>The interface functions can only be called if you have an interface object; they are not directly available
on variant types without explicitly casting (<code>Foo("...").SomeFunction()</code>).</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m not strongly for the <code>for</code> keyword syntax, it&rsquo;s just a suggestion. The core idea is that
you define an interface and you define the types it closes over. Somehow.)</p>

<p>A better example would be an interface for a message-passing system for Raft:</p>

<p>There is no need for the default case, unless you wish to leave one or more of the cases out.</p>

<p>Ideally, these could be implemented as inline structs instead of using dynamic dispatch. I&rsquo;m not sure
what this entails for the GC design, but I&rsquo;d love to hear thoughts on this.</p>

<p>We also make it possible to add methods to closed interfaces. This is in the spirit of
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16254">this proposal</a>, where you allow</p>

<p>for closed interfaces.</p>

<p>This aligns more with how sum types are written and used in other languages; instead of assuming
that each method will be a <code>switch</code> on the variant, you can write arbitrary code that <em>may</em> <code>switch</code>
on the type but it can also just call other methods. This is really nice because you can write
methods in <em>both</em> ways &ndash; if it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;responsibility of the inner type&rdquo; kind of method, require it in
the interface and delegate it to the individual types. If it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;responsibility of the interface&rdquo;
method, write it as a method on the interface as a whole. I kind of wish Rust had this, because in Rust
you sometimes end up writing things like:</p>

<p>Yes, this would work better as a trait, but then you lose some niceties of Rust enums. With this
proposal Go can have it both ways.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, thoughts? This is a really rough proposal, and I&rsquo;m not sure how receptive other Gophers will be
to this, nor how complex its implementation would be. I don&rsquo;t really intend to submit this as a formal proposal,
but if someone else wants to they are more than welcome to build on this idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Rust community lately has been focusing a lot on &ldquo;async I/O&rdquo; through the <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/">tokio</a>
project. This is pretty great!</p>

<p>But for many in the community who haven&rsquo;t worked with web servers and related things it&rsquo;s pretty
confusing as to what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve there. When this stuff was being discussed around 1.0,
I was pretty lost as well, having never worked with this stuff before.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s all this Async I/O business about? What are coroutines? Lightweight threads? Futures? How
does this all fit together?</p>

<h2>What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>

<p>One of Rust&rsquo;s key features is &ldquo;fearless concurrency&rdquo;. But the kind of concurrency required for handling a
large amount of I/O bound tasks &ndash; the kind of concurrency found in Go, Elixir, Erlang &ndash; is absent
from Rust.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to build something like a web service. It&rsquo;s going to be handling thousands of
requests at any point in time (known as the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">c10k</a> problem&rdquo;). In general, the problem we&rsquo;re
considering is having a huge number of I/O bound (usually network I/O) tasks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Handling N things at once&rdquo; is best done by using threads. But &hellip; <em>thousands</em> of threads? That
sounds a bit much. Threads can be pretty expensive: Each thread needs to allocate a large stack,
setting up a thread involves a bunch of syscalls, and context switching is expensive.</p>

<p>Of course, thousands of threads <em>all doing work</em> at once is not going to work anyway. You only
have a fixed number of cores, and at any one time only one thread will be running on a core.</p>

<p>But for cases like web servers, most of these threads won&rsquo;t be doing work. They&rsquo;ll be waiting on the
network. Most of these threads will either be listening for a request, or waiting for their response
to get sent.</p>

<p>With regular threads, when you perform a blocking I/O operation, the syscall returns control
to the kernel, which won&rsquo;t yield control back, because the I/O operation is probably not finished.
Instead, it will use this as an opportunity to swap in a different thread, and will swap the original
thread back when its I/O operation is finished (i.e. it&rsquo;s &ldquo;unblocked&rdquo;). Without Tokio and friends,
this is how you would handle such things in Rust. Spawn a million threads; let the OS deal with
scheduling based on I/O.</p>

<p>But, as we already discovered, threads don&rsquo;t scale well for things like this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We need &ldquo;lighter&rdquo; threads.</p>

<h2>Lightweight threading</h2>

<p>I think the best way to understand lightweight threading is to forget about Rust for a moment
and look at a language that does this well, Go.</p>

<p>Instead of using OS threads, Go has lightweight threads, called &ldquo;goroutines&rdquo;. You spawn these with the <code>go</code>
keyword. A web server might do something like this:</p>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">go</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a loop which waits for new TCP connections, and spawns a goroutine with the connection
and the function <code>handler</code>. Each connection will be a new goroutine, and the goroutine will shut down
when <code>handler</code> finishes. In the meantime, the main loop continues executing, because it&rsquo;s running in
a different goroutine.</p>

<p>So if these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;real&rdquo; (operating system) threads, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p>A goroutine is an example of a &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; thread. The operating system doesn&rsquo;t know about these,
it sees N threads owned by the Go runtime, and the Go runtime maps M goroutines onto them<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, swapping
goroutines in and out much like the operating system scheduler. It&rsquo;s able to do this because
Go code is already interruptible for the GC to be able to run, so the scheduler can always ask goroutines
to stop. The scheduler is also aware of I/O, so when a goroutine is waiting on I/O it yields to the scheduler.</p>

<p>Essentialy, a compiled Go function will have a bunch of points scattered throughout it where it
tells the scheduler and GC &ldquo;take over if you want&rdquo; (and also &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting on stuff, please take
over&rdquo;).</p>

<p>When a goroutine is swapped on an OS thread, some registers will be saved, and
the program counter will switch to the new goroutine.</p>

<p>But what about its stack? OS threads have a large stack with them, and you kinda need a stack for functions
and stuff to work.</p>

<p>What Go used to do was segmented stacks. The reason a thread needs a large stack is that most
programming languages, including C, expect the stack to be contiguous, and stacks can&rsquo;t just be
&ldquo;reallocated&rdquo; like we do with growable buffers since we expect stack data to stay put so that
pointers to stack data to continue to work. So we reserve all the stack we think we&rsquo;ll ever need
(~8MB), and hope we don&rsquo;t need more.</p>

<p>But the expectation of stacks being contiguous isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary. In Go, stacks are made of tiny
chunks. When a function is called, it checks if there&rsquo;s enough space on the stack for it to run, and if not,
allocates a new chunk of stack and runs on it. So if you have thousands of threads doing a small amount of work,
they&rsquo;ll all get thousands of tiny stacks and it will be fine.</p>

<p>These days, Go actually does something different; it <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-stacks-are-handled-in-go/">copies stacks</a>. I mentioned that stacks can&rsquo;t
just be &ldquo;reallocated&rdquo; we expect stack data to stay put. But that&rsquo;s not necessarily true &mdash;
because Go has a GC it knows what all the pointers are <em>anyway</em>, and it can rewrite pointers to
stack data on demand.</p>

<p>Either way, Go&rsquo;s rich runtime lets it handle this stuff well. Goroutines are super cheap, and you can spawn
thousands without your computer having problems.</p>

<p>Rust <em>used</em> to support lightweight/&ldquo;green&rdquo; threads (I believe it used segmented stacks). However, Rust cares
a lot about not paying for things you don&rsquo;t use, and this imposes a penalty on all your code even if you
aren&rsquo;t using green threads, and it was removed pre-1.0.</p>

<h2>Async I/O</h2>

<p>A core building block of this is Async I/O. As mentioned in the previous section,
with regular blocking I/O, the moment you request I/O your thread will not be allowed to run
(&ldquo;blocked&rdquo;) until the operation is done. This is perfect when working with OS threads (the OS
scheduler does all the work for you!), but if you have lightweight threads you instead want to
replace the lightweight thread running on the OS thread with a different one.</p>

<p>Instead, you use non-blocking I/O, where the thread queues a request for I/O with the OS and continues
execution. The I/O request is executed at some later point by the kernel. The thread then needs to ask the
OS &ldquo;Is this I/O request ready yet?&rdquo; before looking at the result of the I/O.</p>

<p>Of course, repeatedly asking the OS if it&rsquo;s done can be tedious and consume resources. This is why
there are system calls like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll"><code>epoll</code></a>. Here, you can bundle together a bunch of unfinished I/O requests,
and then ask the OS to wake up your thread when <em>any</em> of these completes. So you can have a scheduler
thread (a real thread) that swaps out lightweight threads that are waiting on I/O, and when there&rsquo;s nothing
else happening it can itself go to sleep with an <code>epoll</code> call until the OS wakes it up (when one of the I/O
requests completes).</p>

<p>(The exact mechanism involved here is probably more complex)</p>

<p>So, bringing this to Rust, Rust has the <a href="https://github.com/carllerche/mio">mio</a> library, which is a platform-agnostic
wrapper around non-blocking I/O and tools like epoll/kqueue/etc. It&rsquo;s a building block; and while
those used to directly using <code>epoll</code> in C may find it helpful, it doesn&rsquo;t provide a nice programming
model like Go does. But we can get there.</p>

<h2>Futures</h2>

<p>These are another building block. A <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.17/futures/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a> is the promise of eventually having a value
(in fact, in Javascript these are called <code>Promise</code>s).</p>

<p>So for example, you can ask to listen on a network socket, and get a <code>Future</code> back  (actually, a
<code>Stream</code>, which is like a future but for a sequence of values). This <code>Future</code> won&rsquo;t contain the
response <em>yet</em>, but will know when it&rsquo;s ready. You can <code>wait()</code> on a <code>Future</code>, which will block
until you have a result, and you can also <code>poll()</code> it, asking it if it&rsquo;s done yet (it will give you
the result if it is).</p>

<p>Futures can also be chained, so you can do stuff like <code>future.then(|result| process(result))</code>.
The closure passed to <code>then</code> itself can produce another future, so you can chain together
things like I/O operations. With chained futures, <code>poll()</code> is how you make progress; each time
you call it it will move on to the next future provided the existing one is ready.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good abstraction over things like non-blocking I/O.</p>

<p>Chaining futures works much like chaining iterators. Each <code>and_then</code> (or whatever combinator)
call returns a struct wrapping around the inner future, which may contain an additional closure.
Closures themselves carry their references and data with them, so this really ends up being
very similar to a tiny stack!</p>

<h2>🗼 Tokio 🗼</h2>

<p>Tokio&rsquo;s essentially a nice wrapper around mio that uses futures. Tokio has a core
event loop, and you feed it closures that return futures. What it will do is
run all the closures you feed it, use mio to efficiently figure out which futures
are ready to make a step<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and make progress on them (by calling <code>poll()</code>).</p>

<p>This actually is already pretty similar to what Go was doing, at a conceptual level.
You have to manually set up the Tokio event loop (the &ldquo;scheduler&rdquo;), but once you do
you can feed it tasks which intermittently do I/O, and the event loop takes
care of swapping over to a new task when one is blocked on I/O. A crucial difference is
that Tokio is single threaded, whereas the Go scheduler can use multiple OS threads
for execution. However, you can offload CPU-critical tasks onto other OS threads and
use channels to coordinate so this isn&rsquo;t that big a deal.</p>

<p>While at a conceptual level this is beginning to shape up to be similar to what we had for Go, code-wise this doesn&rsquo;t look so pretty. For the following Go code:</p>

<p>Not pretty. <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.25/futures/future/fn.loop_fn.html#examples">The code gets worse if you introduce branches and loops</a>. The problem is that in Go we
got the interruption points for free, but in Rust we have to encode this by chaining up combinators
into a kind of state machine. Ew.</p>

<h2>Generators and async/await</h2>

<p>This is where generators (also called coroutines) come in.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html">Generators</a> are an experimental feature in Rust. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p>Functions are things which execute a task and return once. On the other hand, generators
return multiple times; they pause execution to &ldquo;yield&rdquo; some data, and can be resumed
at which point they will run until the next yield. While my example doesn&rsquo;t show this, generators
can also finish executing like regular functions.</p>

<p>Closures in Rust are
<a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/">sugar for a struct containing captured data, plus an implementation of one of the <code>Fn</code> traits to make it callable</a>.</p>

<p>Generators are similar, except they implement the <code>Generator</code> trait<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and usually store an enum representing various states.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html#generators-as-state-machines">unstable book</a> has some examples on what the generator state machine enum will look like.</p>

<p>This is much closer to what we were looking for! Now our code can look like this:</p>

<p>where <code>futurify</code> is a function that takes a generator and returns a future which on
each <code>poll</code> call will <code>resume()</code> the generator, and return <code>NotReady</code> until the generator
finishes executing.</p>

<p>But wait, this is even <em>more</em> ugly! What was the point of converting our relatively
clean callback-chaining code into this mess?</p>

<p>Well, if you look at it, this code now looks <em>linear</em>. We&rsquo;ve converted our callback
code to the same linear flow as the Go code, however it has this weird loop-yield boilerplate
and the <code>futurify</code> function and is overall not very neat.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s where <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await">futures-await</a> comes in. <code>futures-await</code> is a procedural macro that
does the last-mile work of packaging away this boilerplate. It essentially lets you write
the above function as</p>

<p>Nice and clean. Almost as clean as the Go code, just that we have explicit <code>await!()</code> calls. These
await calls are basically providing the same function as the interruption points that Go code
gets implicitly.</p>

<p>And, of course, since it&rsquo;s using a generator under the hood, you can loop and branch and do whatever
else you want as normal, and the code will still be clean.</p>

<h2>Tying it together</h2>

<p>So, in Rust, futures can be chained together to provide a lightweight stack-like system. With async/await,
you can neatly write these future chains, and <code>await</code> provides explicit interruption points on each I/O operation.
Tokio provides an event loop &ldquo;scheduler&rdquo; abstraction, which you can feed async functions to, and under the hood it
uses mio to abstract over low level non-blocking I/O primitives.</p>

<p>These are components which can be used independently &mdash; you can use tokio with futures without
using async/await. You can use async/await without using Tokio. For example, I think this would be
useful for Servo&rsquo;s networking stack. It doesn&rsquo;t need to do <em>much</em> parallel I/O (not at the order
of thousands of threads), so it can just use multiplexed OS threads. However, we&rsquo;d still want
to pool threads and pipeline data well, and async/await would help here.</p>

<p>Put together, all these components get something almost as clean as the Go stuff, with a little more
explicit boilerplate. Because generators (and thus async/await) play nice with the borrow checker
(they&rsquo;re just enum state machines under the hood), Rust&rsquo;s safety guarantees are all still in play,
and we get to have &ldquo;fearless concurrency&rdquo; for programs having a huge quantity of I/O bound tasks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week ago <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html">we put out a call for blog posts for what folks think Rust should do in 2018</a>.</p>

<p>This is mine.</p>

<h2>Overall focus</h2>

<p>I think 2017 was a great year for Rust. Near the beginning of the year, after custom derive
and a bunch of things stabilized, I had a strong feeling that Rust was &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. Not really &ldquo;finished&rdquo;,
there&rsquo;s still tons of stuff to improve, but this was the first time stable Rust was the language
I wanted it to be, and was something I could recommend for most kinds of work without reservations.</p>

<p>I think this is a good signal to wind down the frightening pace of new features Rust has been getting.
And that happened! We had the impl period, which took some time to focus on <em>getting things done</em> before
proposing new things. And Rust is feeling more polished than ever.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-2018/">Nick</a>, I feel like 2018 should be boring. I feel like we should focus on polishing what
we have, implementing all the things, and improving our approachability as a language.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to see this as an extended impl period.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m looking for a moratorium on RFCs, really. Hell, in the past few days I&rsquo;ve posted
one pre-pre-RFC<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, one pre-RFC, and one RFC (from the pre-RFC). I&rsquo;m mostly looking for <em>prioritizing</em> impl
work over designing new things, but still having <em>some</em> focus on design.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>

<p>I think Rust still has some &ldquo;missing bits&rdquo; which make it hard to justify for some use cases. Rust&rsquo;s
async story is being fleshed out. We don&rsquo;t yet have stable SIMD or stable inline ASM. The microcontroller
story is kinda iffy. RLS/clippy need nightly. I&rsquo;d like to see these crystallize and stabilize this year.</p>

<p>I think this year we need to continue to take a critical look at Rust&rsquo;s ergonomics. Last year the
ergonomics initiative was really good for Rust, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of that. This is kind of at
odds with my &ldquo;focus on polishing Rust&rdquo; statement, but fixing ergonomics is not just new features. It&rsquo;s
also about figuring out barriers in Rust, polishing mental models, improving docs/diagnostics, and in
general figuring out how to best present Rust&rsquo;s features. Starting dialogues about confusing bits of
the language and figuring out the best mental model to present them with is something we should
continue doing. Sometimes this may need new features, indeed, but not always. We must continue
to take a critical look at how our language presents itself to newcomers.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a stronger focus on mentoring. Mentoring on rustc, mentoring on major libraries, mentoring on
Rust tooling, mentoring everywhere. This includes not just the mentors, but the associated infrastructure &ndash;
contribution docs, sites like <a href="http://starters.servo.org/">servo-starters</a> and <a href="https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork">findwork</a>, and similar tooling.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping for more companies to invest back into Rust. This year <a href="http://buoyant.io/">Buoyant</a> became pretty well
known within the community, and many of their employees are paid to work on various important parts
of the Rust ecosystem. There are also multiple consulting groups that contribute to the ecosystem.
It&rsquo;s nice to see that &ldquo;paid to work on Rust&rdquo; is no longer limited to Mozilla, and this is crucial
for the health of the language. I hope this trend continues.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to see more companies <em>talk</em> about Rust. Success stories are really nice to hear.
I&rsquo;ve heard many amazing success stories this year, but a lot of them are things which can&rsquo;t be shared.</p>

<h2>Governance</h2>

<p>Last year we started seeing the limits of the RFC process. Large RFCs were stressful for both the RFC authors
and participating community members, and rather opaque for newer community members wishing to participate.
Alternative models have been discussed; I&rsquo;d like to see more movement on this front.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to grow the moderation team; it is currently rather small and doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to handle
incidents in a timely fashion.</p>

<h2>Docs / Learning</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a focus on improving Rust for folks who learn the language by <em>trying things</em> over reading books <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This means better diagnostics, better alternative resources like rustbyexample, etc. Improving mentorship helps here
as well.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;d like to see our normal docs work continue to happen.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m overall really excited for 2018. I think we&rsquo;re doing great on most fronts so far, and if we
maintain the momentum we&rsquo;ll have an even-more-awesome Rust by the end of this year!</p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>There is literally no programming language I&rsquo;ve personally learned through a book or formal teaching.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Julia Evans wrote an <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/12/23/segfault-debugging/">excellent post</a> about debugging a segfault in Rust. (Go read it, it&rsquo;s good)</p>

<p>One thing it mentioned was</p>

<blockquote><p>I think “undefined” and “unsafe” are considered to be synonyms.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is &hellip; incorrect. However, we in the Rust community have never really explicitly outlined the
distinction, so that confusion is on us! This blog post is an attempt to clarify the difference of
terminology as used within the Rust community. It&rsquo;s a very useful but subtle distinction and I feel we&rsquo;d be
able to talk about safety more expressively if this was well known.</p>

<h2>Unsafe means two things in Rust, yay</h2>

<p>So, first off, the waters are a bit muddied by the fact that Rust uses <code>unsafe</code> to both mean &ldquo;within
an <code>unsafe {}</code> block&rdquo; and &ldquo;something Bad is happening here&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s possible to have safe code
within an <code>unsafe</code> block; indeed this is the <em>primary function</em> of an <code>unsafe</code> block. Somewhat
counterintutively, the <code>unsafe</code> block&rsquo;s purpose is to actually tell the compiler &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t
like this code but trust me, it&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo; (where &ldquo;safe&rdquo; is the negation of the <em>second</em> meaning of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;something Bad is not happening here&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Similarly, we use &ldquo;safe code&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;code not using <code>unsafe{}</code> blocks&rdquo; but also &ldquo;code that is not unsafe&rdquo;,
i.e. &ldquo;code where nothing bad happens&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This blog post is primarily about the &ldquo;something bad is happening here&rdquo; meaning of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;. When referring
to the other kind I&rsquo;ll specifically say &ldquo;code within <code>unsafe</code> blocks&rdquo; or something like that.</p>

<h2>Undefined behavior</h2>

<p>In languages like C, C++, and Rust, undefined behavior is when you reach a point where
the compiler is allowed to do anything with your code. This is distinct from implementation-defined
behavior, where usually a given compiler/library will do a deterministic thing, however they have some
freedom from the spec in deciding what that thing is.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior can be pretty scary. This is usually because in practice it causes problems when
the compiler assumes &ldquo;X won&rsquo;t happen because it is undefined behavior&rdquo;, and X ends up happening,
breaking the assumptions. In some cases this does nothing dangerous, but often the compiler will
end up doing wacky things to your code. Dereferencing a null pointer will <em>sometimes</em> cause segfaults
(which is the compiler generating code that actually dereferences the pointer, making the kernel
complain), but sometimes it will be optimized in a way that assumes it won&rsquo;t and moves around code
such that you have major problems.</p>

<p>Undefined behavior is a global property, based on how your code is <em>used</em>. The following function
in C++ or Rust may or may not exhibit undefined behavior, based on how it gets used:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// do not try this at home</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">deref</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="kt">u32</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">u32</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As long as you always call it with a valid pointer to an integer, there is no undefined behavior
involved.</p>

<p>But in either language, if you use it with some pointer conjured out of thin air (like <code>0x01</code>), that&rsquo;s
probably undefined behavior.</p>

<p>As it stands, UB is a property of the entire program and its execution. Sometimes you may have snippets of code
that will always exhibit undefined behavior regardless of how they are called, but in general UB
is a global property.</p>

<h2>Unsafe behavior</h2>

<p>Rust&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;unsafe behavior&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m coining this term because &ldquo;unsafety&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsafe code&rdquo; can
be a bit confusing) is far more scoped. Here, <code>fn deref</code> <em>is</em> &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, even if you <em>always</em>
call it with a valid pointer. The reason it is still unsafe is because it&rsquo;s possible to trigger UB by only
changing the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; caller code. I.e. &ldquo;changes to code outside unsafe blocks can trigger UB if they include
calls to this function&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Basically, in Rust a bit of code is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; if it cannot exhibit undefined behavior under all circumstances of
that code being used. The following code exhibits &ldquo;safe behavior&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We dereferenced a raw pointer, but we knew it was valid. Of course, actual <code>unsafe</code> blocks will
usually be &ldquo;actually totally safe&rdquo; for less obvious reasons, and part of this is because
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/working-with-unsafe.html#working-with-unsafe"><code>unsafe</code> blocks sometimes can pollute the entire module</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in Rust is a more local property. Code isn&rsquo;t safe just because you only use it in
a way that doesn&rsquo;t trigger UB, it is safe because there is literally <em>no way to use it such that it
will do so</em>. No way to do so without using <code>unsafe</code> blocks, that is<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a distinction that&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> to draw in Rust because it gives us the ability
to compartmentalize safety. Trying to apply this definition to C++ is problematic; you can
ask &ldquo;is <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> safe?&rdquo;, but you can <em>always</em> use it within code in a way that you trigger
undefined behavior, because C++ does not have the tools for compartmentalizing safety. The distinction
between &ldquo;code which doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about safety&rdquo; and &ldquo;code which does need to worry about safety&rdquo;
exists in Rust in the form of &ldquo;code outside of <code>unsafe {}</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;code within <code>unsafe {}</code>&rdquo;, whereas in
C++ it&rsquo;s a lot fuzzier and based on expectations (and documentation/the spec).</p>

<p>So C++&rsquo;s <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the sense that it does what you expect but
if you use it in a way counter to how it&rsquo;s <em>supposed</em> to be used (constructing one from an invalid pointer, for example)
it can blow up. This is still a useful sense of safety, and is how one regularly reasons about safety in C++. However it&rsquo;s not
the same sense of the term as used in Rust, which can be a bit more formal about what the expectations
actually are.</p>

<p>So <code>unsafe</code> in Rust is a strictly more general concept &ndash; all code exhibiting undefined behavior in Rust is also &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;,
however not all &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; code in Rust exhibits undefined behavior as written in the current program.</p>

<p>Rust furthermore attempts to guarantee that you will not trigger undefined behavior if you do not use <code>unsafe {}</code> blocks.
This of course depends on the correctness of the compiler (it has bugs) and of the libraries you use (they may also have bugs)
but this compartmentalization gets you most of the way there in having UB-free programs.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Once again in we have a slight difference between an &ldquo;<code>unsafe fn</code>&rdquo;, i.e. a function that needs an <code>unsafe</code> block to call and probably is unsafe, and an &ldquo;unsafe function&rdquo;, a function that exhibits unsafe behavior.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>This caveat and the confusing dual-usage of the term &ldquo;safe&rdquo; lead to the rather tautological-sounding sentence &ldquo;Safe Rust code is Rust code that cannot cause undefined behavior when used in safe Rust code&rdquo;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
