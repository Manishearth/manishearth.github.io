    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while now I&rsquo;ve been quite interested in compilers and systems programming in general; and I
feel that an important feature of systems programming is that it&rsquo;s relatively easy to figure out
what a line of code does (modulo optimizations) at the OS or hardware level<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Conversely, it&rsquo;s
important to know how your tools work more than ever in systems programming. So when I see a
language feature I&rsquo;m not familiar with, I&rsquo;m interested in finding out how it works under the hood.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a C++ expert. I can work on C++ codebases, but I&rsquo;m not anywhere near knowing all of the
features and nuances of C++. However, I am pretty good at Rust and understand a decent portion of
the compiler internals. This gives me a great perspective &mdash; I&rsquo;ve not yet internalized most C++
features to take them for granted, and I&rsquo;m well equipped to investigate these features.</p>

<p>Today I came across some C++ code similar to the following<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">void foo() {
    static SomeType bar = Env()-&gt;someMethod();
    static OtherType baz = Env()-&gt;otherMethod(bar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code piqued my interest. Specifically, the local <code>static</code> stuff. I knew that when you have a
static like</p>

<pre><code>static int FOO = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>1</code> is stored somewhere in the <code>.data</code> section of the program. This is easily verified with <code>gdb</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">static int THING = 0xAAAA;

int main() {
 return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ g++ test.cpp -g
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601038.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601038
THING in section .data
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically a part of the compiled program as it is loaded into memory.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you have a <code>static</code> that is initialized with a function, it&rsquo;s stored in the <code>.bss</code>
section, and initialized before <code>main()</code>. Again, easily verified:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int bar() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"bar called\n";
 return 0xFAFAFA;
}

static int THING = bar();

int main() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"main called\n";
 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ ./a.out 
bar called
main called
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601198.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601198
THING in section .bss
</code></pre>

<p>We can also leave statics uninitialized (<code>static int THING;</code>) and they will be placed in <code>.bss</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now back to the original snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">void foo() {
    static SomeType bar = Env()-&gt;someMethod();
    static OtherType baz = Env()-&gt;otherMethod(bar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Naïvely one might say that these are statics which are scoped locally to avoid name clashes. It&rsquo;s
not much different from <code>static THING = bar()</code> aside from the fact that it isn&rsquo;t a global
identifier.</p>

<p>However, this isn&rsquo;t the case. What tipped me off was that this called <code>Env()</code>, and I wasn&rsquo;t so sure
that the environment was guaranteed to be properly initialized and available before <code>main()</code> is
called <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Instead, these are statics which are initialized the first time the function is called.</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int bar() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"bar called\n";
 return 0xFAFAFA;
}

void foo() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"foo called\n";
 static int i = bar();
 cout&lt;&lt;"Static is:"&lt;&lt; i&lt;&lt;"\n";
}

int main() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"main called\n";
 foo();
 foo();
 foo();
 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ g++ test.cpp
$ ./a.out
main called
foo called
bar called
Static is:16448250
foo called
Static is:16448250
foo called
Static is:16448250
</code></pre>

<p>Wait, &ldquo;the first time the function is called&rdquo;? <em>Alarm bells go off&hellip;</em> Surely there&rsquo;s some cost to that! Let&rsquo;s investigate.</p>

<pre><code class="text">$ gdb a.out
(gdb) disas bar

   // snip
</code></pre>

<p>The instruction at <code>+44</code> calls <code>bar()</code>, and it seems to be surrounded by calls to some <code>__cxa_guard</code>
functions.</p>

<p>We can take a naïve guess at what this does: It probably just sets a hidden static flag on
initialization which ensures that it only runs once.</p>

<p>Of course, the actual solution isn&rsquo;t as simple. It needs to avoid data races, handle errors, and
somehow take care of recursive initialization.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the <a href="http://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#once-ctor">spec</a> and one <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">implementation</a>, found by searching for
<code>__cxa_guard</code>.</p>

<p>Both of them show us the generated code for initializing things like local statics:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">  if (obj_guard.first_byte == 0) {
    if ( __cxa_guard_acquire (&amp;obj_guard) ) {
      try {
      // ... initialize the object ...;
      } catch (...) {
        __cxa_guard_abort (&amp;obj_guard);
        throw;
      }
      // ... queue object destructor with __cxa_atexit() ...;
      __cxa_guard_release (&amp;obj_guard);
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>obj_guard</code> is our &ldquo;hidden static flag&rdquo;, with some other extra data.</p>

<p><code>__cxa_guard_acquire</code> and <code>__cxa_guard_release</code> acquire and release a lock to prevent recursive
initialization. So this program will crash:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

void foo(bool recur);

int bar(bool recur) {
 cout&lt;&lt;"bar called\n";
 if(recur) {
    foo(false);
 }
 return 0xFAFAFA;
}

void foo(bool recur) {
 cout&lt;&lt;"foo called\n";
 static int i = bar(recur);
 cout&lt;&lt;"Static is:"&lt;&lt; i&lt;&lt;"\n";
}



int main() {
 foo(true);
 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ g++ test.cpp
$ ./a.out 
foo called
bar called
foo called
terminate called after throwing an instance of '__gnu_cxx::recursive_init_error'
  what():  std::exception
Aborted (core dumped)
</code></pre>

<p>Over here, to initialize <code>i</code>, <code>bar()</code> needs to be called, but <code>bar()</code> calls <code>foo()</code> which needs <code>i</code>
to be initialized, which again will call <code>bar()</code> (though this time it won&rsquo;t recurse). If <code>i</code> wasn&rsquo;t
<code>static</code> it would be fine, but now we have two calls trying to initialize <code>i</code>, and it&rsquo;s unclear as
to which value should be used.</p>

<p>The implementation is pretty interesting. Before looking at the code my quick guess was that the
following would happen for local statics:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>obj_guard</code> is a struct containing a mutex and a flag with three states:
&ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo;, &ldquo;initializing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;initialized&rdquo;. Alternatively, use an atomic state indicator.</li>
<li>When we try to initialize for the first time, the mutex is locked, the flag is set
to &ldquo;initializing&rdquo;, the mutex is released, the value is initialized, and the flag is set to &ldquo;initialized&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is &ldquo;initialized&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t initialize again</li>
<li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is &ldquo;initializing&rdquo;, throw some exception</li>
</ul>


<p> (We need the tristate flag because without it recursion would cause deadlocks)</p>

<p>I suppose that this implementation would work, though it&rsquo;s not the one being used. The
<a href="https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/master/libc/bionic/__cxa_guard.cpp">implementation in bionic</a> (the Android version of the C stdlib) is similar; it
uses per-static atomics which indicate various states. However, it does not throw an exception when
we have a recursive initialization, it instead seems to deadlock<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This is okay because the C++
spec says (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n2356/stmt.html#stmt.dcl">Section 6.7.4</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being initialized, the
behavior is undefined.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, the implementations in <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/guard.cc">gcc/libstdc++</a> (also <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">this version</a> of
<code>libcppabi</code> from Apple, which is a bit more readable) do something different. They use a global
recursive mutex to handle reentrancy. Recursive mutexes basically can be locked multiple times by a
single thread, but cannot be locked by another thread till the locking thread unlocks them the same
number of times. This means that recursion/reentrancy won&rsquo;t cause deadlocks, but we still have one-
thread-at-a-time access. What these implementations do is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>guard_object</code> is a set of two flags, one which indicates if the static is initialized,
and one which indicates that the static is being initialized (&ldquo;in use&rdquo;)</li>
<li>If the object is initialized, do nothing (this doesn&rsquo;t use mutexes and is cheap).
This isn&rsquo;t exactly part of the implementation in the library, but is part of the generated code.</li>
<li>If it isn&rsquo;t initialized, acquire the global recursive lock</li>
<li>If the object is initialized by the time the lock was acquired, unlock and return</li>
<li>If not, check if the static is being initialized from the second <code>guard_object</code> flag. If it is
&ldquo;in use&rdquo;, throw an exception.</li>
<li>If it wasn&rsquo;t, mark the second flag of the static&rsquo;s guard object as being &ldquo;in use&rdquo;</li>
<li>Call the initialization function, bubble errors</li>
<li>Unlock the global mutex</li>
<li>Mark the second flag as &ldquo;not in use&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>At any one time, only one thread will be in the process of running initialization routines, due to
the global recursive mutex. Since the mutex is recursive, a function (eg <code>bar()</code>) used for
initializing local statics may itself use (different) local statics. Due to the &ldquo;in use&rdquo; flag, the
initialization of a local static may not recursively call its parent function without causing an
error.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t need per-static atomics, and doesn&rsquo;t deadlock, however it has the cost of a global
mutex which is called at most once per local static. In a highly threaded situation with lots of
such statics, one might want to reevaluate directly using local statics.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxxabi/blob/master/src/cxa_guard.cpp#L188">LLVM&rsquo;s libcxxabi</a> is similar to the <code>libstdc++</code> implementation, but instead of a recursive
mutex it uses a regular mutex (on non-ARM Apple systems) which is unlocked before
<code>__cxa_guard_acquire</code> exits and tests for reentrancy by noting the thread ID in the guard object
instead of the &ldquo;in use&rdquo; flag. Condvars are used for waiting for a thread to stop using an object. On
other platforms, it seems to deadlock, though I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>So here we have a rather innocent-looking feature that has some hidden costs and pitfalls. But now I
can look at a line of code where this feature is being used, and have a good idea of what&rsquo;s
happening there. One step closer to being a better systems programmer!</p>
