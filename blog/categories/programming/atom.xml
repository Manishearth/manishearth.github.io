    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s been some discussion about arenas in Rust recently, and I thought I’d write about them.</p>

<p>Arenas aren’t something you would typically reach for in Rust so fewer people know about them; you only really see them in applications for various niche use cases. Usually you can use an arena by pulling in a crate and not using additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code>, so there’s no need to be particularly skittish around them in Rust, and it seems like it would be useful knowledge, especially for people coming to Rust from fields where arenas are more common.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there’s a set of <em>really cool</em> lifetime effects involved when implementing self-referential arenas, that I don’t think have been written about before.</p>

<p>I’m mostly writing this to talk about the cool lifetime effects, but I figured it’s worth writing a general introduction that has something for all Rustaceans. If you know what arenas are and just want the cool lifetimes you can skip directly to <a href="#implementing-a-self-referential-arena">the section on implementing self-referential arenas</a>. Otherwise, read on.</p>

<h2 id="whats-an-arena">What’s an arena?</h2>

<p>An arena is essentially a way to group up allocations that are expected to have the same lifetime. Sometimes you need to allocate a bunch of objects for the lifetime of an event, after which they can all be thrown away wholesale. It’s inefficient to call into the system allocator each time, and far more preferable to <em>preallocate</em> a bunch of memory for your objects, cleaning it all up at once once you’re done with them.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are two reasons you might wish to use an arena:</p>

<p>Firstly, your primary goal may be to reduce allocation pressure, as mentioned above. For example, in a game or application, there may be large mishmash of per-frame-tick objects that need to get allocated each frame, and then thrown away. This is <em>extremely</em> common in game development in particular, and allocator pressure is something gamedevs tend to care about. With arenas, it’s easy enough to allocate an arena, fill it up during each frame and clear it out once the frame is over. This has additional benefits of cache locality: you can ensure that most of the per-frame objects (which are likely used more often than other objects) are usually in cache during the frame, since they’ve been allocated adjacently.</p>

<p>Another goal might be that you want to write self referential data, like a complex graph with cycles, that can get cleaned up all at once. For example, when writing compilers, type information will likely need to reference other types and other such data, leading to a complex, potentially cyclic graph of types. Once you’ve computed a type you probably don’t need to throw it away individually, so you can use an arena to store all your computed type information, cleaning the whole thing up at once when you’re at a stage where the types don’t matter anymore. Using this pattern allows your code to not have to worry about whether the self-referential bits get deallocated “early”, it lets you make the assumption that if you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ty</code> it lives as long as all the other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ty</code>s and can reference them directly.</p>

<p>These two goals are not necessarily disjoint: You may wish to use an arena to achieve both goals simultaneously. But you can also just have an arena that disallows self referential types (but has other nice properties). Later in this post I’m going to implement an arena that allows self-referential types but is not great on allocation pressure, mostly for ease of implementation. <em>Typically</em> if you’re writing an arena for self-referential types you can make it simultaneously reduce allocator pressure, but there can be tradeoffs.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-use-an-arena-in-rust">How can I use an arena in Rust?</h2>

<p>Typically to <em>use</em> an arena you can just pull in a crate that implements the right kind of arena. There are two that I know of that I’ll talk about below, though <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=arena">a cursory search of “arena” on crates.io</a> turns up many other promising candidates.</p>

<p>I’ll note that if you just need cyclic graph structures, you don’t <em>have</em> to use an arena, the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/petgraph/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">petgraph</code></a> crate is often sufficient. <a href="https://docs.rs/slotmap/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slotmap</code></a> is also useful; it’s a map-like datastructure useful for self-referential data, based on generational indexing.</p>

<h3 id="bumpalo">Bumpalo</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bumpalo</code></a> is a fast “bump allocator”, which allows heterogenous contents, and only allows cycles if you do not care about destructors getting run.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">bumpalo</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">Bump</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>Every call to <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo/3.6.1/bumpalo/struct.Bump.html#method.alloc"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bump::alloc()</code></a> returns a mutable reference to the allocated object. You can allocate different objects, and they can even reference each other<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. By default it does not call destructors on its contents; however you can use <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo/3.6.1/bumpalo/boxed/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bumpalo::boxed</code></a> (or custom allocators on Nightly) to get this behavior. You can similarly use <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo/3.6.1/bumpalo/collections/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bumpalo::collections</code></a> to get <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bumpalo</code></a>-backed vectors and strings. <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo/3.6.1/bumpalo/boxed/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bumpalo::boxed</code></a> will not be allowed to participate in cycles.</p>

<h3 id="typed-arena"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed-arena</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/typed-arena/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed-arena</code></a> is an arena allocator that can only store objects of a single type, but it does allow for setting up cyclic references:</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bumpalo</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/typed-arena/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed-arena</code></a> will always run destructors on its contents when the arena itself goes out of scope<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-a-self-referential-arena">Implementing a self-referential arena</h2>

<p>Self referential arenas are interesting because, typically, Rust is very very wary of self-referential data. But arenas let you clearly separate the step of “I don’t care about this object” and “this object can be deleted” in a way that is sufficient to allow self-referential and cyclic types.</p>

<p>It’s pretty rare to need to implement your own arena – <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bumpalo</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/typed-arena/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed-arena</code></a> cover most of the use cases, and if they don’t cover yours you probably can find something that does on <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=arena">crates.io</a>. But if you really need to, or if you’re interested in the nitty-gritty lifetime details, this section is for you.</p>

<div class="post-aside">
<p>For people less familiar with lifetimes: the lifetimes in the syntaxes <code>&amp;'a Foo</code> and <code>Foo&lt;'b&gt;</code> mean different things. <code>'a</code> in <code>&amp;'a Foo</code> is the lifetime <em>of</em> <code>Foo</code>, or, at least the lifetime of <em>this</em> reference to <code>Foo</code>. <code>'b</code> in <code>Foo&lt;'b&gt;</code> is a lifetime <em>parameter</em> of <code>Foo</code>, and typically means something like “the lifetime of data <code>Foo</code> is allowed to reference”.</p>
</div>

<p>The key to implementing an arena <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> with entries typed as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Entry</code> is in the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Entry</code> should both have a lifetime parameter: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Entry&lt;'arena&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> methods should all receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena self</code>, i.e. their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> type is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Entry</code> should almost always be passed around as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena Entry&lt;'arena&gt;</code> (it’s useful to make an alias for this)</li>
  <li>Use interior mutability; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut self</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> will make everything stop compiling. If using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> for mutability, make sure you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhantomData</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;Entry&lt;'arena&gt;&gt;</code> somewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s basically it from the lifetime side, the rest is all in figuring what API you want and implementing the backing storage. Armed with the above rules you should be able to make your custom arena work with the guarantees you need without having to understand what’s going on with the underlying lifetimes.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an implementation example, and then dissect <em>why</em> it works.</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>My crate <a href="https://docs.rs/elsa"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elsa</code></a> implements an arena in 100% safe code <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/elsa/blob/915d26008d8bae069927c551da506dba05d2755b/examples/mutable_arena.rs">in one of its examples</a>. This arena does <em>not</em> save on allocations since <a href="https://docs.rs/elsa/1.4.0/elsa/vec/struct.FrozenVec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elsa::FrozenVec</code></a> requires its contents be behind some indirection, and it’s not generic, but it’s a reasonable way to illustrate how the lifetimes work without getting into the weeds of implementing a <em>really good</em> arena with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code>.</p>

<p>The example implements an arena of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person&lt;'arena&gt;</code> types, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code>. The goal is to implement some kind of directed social graph, which may have cycles.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">elsa</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">FrozenVec</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/elsa/1.4.0/elsa/vec/struct.FrozenVec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elsa::FrozenVec</code></a> is an append-only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>-like abstraction that allows you to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.push()</code> without needing a mutable reference, and is how we’ll be able to implement this arena in safe code.</p>

<p>Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person&lt;'arena&gt;</code> has a list of people they follow but also keeps track of people who follow them:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'arena</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'static</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">// following the rule above about references to entry types</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lifetime <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> is essentially “the lifetime of the arena itself”. This is where it starts getting weird: typically if your type has a lifetime <em>parameter</em>, the caller gets to pick what goes in there. You don’t get to just say “this is the lifetime of the object itself”, the caller would typically be able to instantiate an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'static&gt;</code> if they wish, or an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'a&gt;</code> for some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code>. But here we’re declaring that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> is the lifetime of the arena itself; clearly something fishy is happening here.</p>

<p>Here’s where we actually implement the arena:</p>

<p>Note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena self</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_person</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>good</em> implementation here would typically separate out code handling the higher level invariant of “if A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follows</code> B then B <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse_follows</code> A”, but this is just an example.</p>

<p>In this case all of the “mutability” happens in the implementation of the arena itself, but it would be possible for this code to add entries directly to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follows</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse_follows</code> lists, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> could have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell</code>s for other kinds of links, or whatever.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-lifetimes-work">How the lifetimes work</h3>

<p>So how does this work? As I said earlier, with such abstractions in Rust, the caller typically has freedom to set the lifetime based on what they do with it. For example, if you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HashMap&lt;K, &amp;'a str&gt;</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code> will get set based on the lifetime of what you try to insert.</p>

<p>When you construct the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> its lifetime parameter is indeed still unconstrained, and we can test this by checking that the following code, which forcibly constrains the lifetime, still compiles.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">arena</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Arena</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'static</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Arena</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the moment you try to do anything with the arena, this stops working:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">arena</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Arena</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'static</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Arena</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">lonely</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">arena</span><span class="nf">.add_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"lonely"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>error[E0597]: `arena` does not live long enough

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_person</code> method is somehow suddenly forcing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> parameter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> to be set to its <em>own</em> lifetime, constraining it (and making it impossible to force-constrain it to be anything else with type annotations).</p>

<p>What’s going on here is a neat interaction with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena self</code> signature of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_person</code> (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena Arena&lt;'self&gt;</code>), and the fact that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> is an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html#variance"><em>invariant lifetime</em></a>.</p>

<p>Usually in your Rust programs, lifetimes are a little bit stretchy-squeezy. The following code compiles just fine:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// ask for two strings *with the same lifetime*</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">take_strings</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">'a</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<span class="c">// string literal with lifetime 'static</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">lives_forever</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c">// owned string with shorter, local lifetime</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">short_lived</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">String</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"bar"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c">// still works!</span>
<span class="nf">take_strings</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lives_forever</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;*</span><span class="n">short_lived</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this code, Rust is happy to notice that while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lives_forever</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;*short_lived</code> have different lifetimes, it’s totally acceptable to <em>pretend</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lives_forever</code> has a shorter lifetime for the duration of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">take_strings</code> function. It’s just a reference, a reference valid for a long lifetime is <em>also</em> valid for a shorter lifetime.</p>

<p>The thing is, this stretchy-squeeziness is not the same for all lifetimes! The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html">nomicon chapter on subtyping and variance</a> goes into detail on <em>why</em> this is the case, but a general rule of thumb is that most lifetimes are “squeezy”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup> like the one in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'a str</code> above, but if some form of mutability is involved, they are rigid, also known as “invariant”. You can also have “stretchy”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup> lifetimes if you’re using function types, but they’re rare.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> is using interior mutability (via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FrozenVec</code>) in a way that makes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> invariant.</p>

<p>Let’s look at our two lines of code again. When the compiler sees the first line of the code below, it constructs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arena</code>, whose lifetime we’ll call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code>. At this point the type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arena</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'?&gt;</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'?</code> is made up notation for a yet-unconstrained lifetime.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">arena</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Arena</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span> 
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">lonely</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">arena</span><span class="nf">.add_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"lonely"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s actually rewrite this to be clearer on what the lifetimes are.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">arena</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Arena</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c">// type Arena&lt;'?&gt;, lives for 'a</span>

<span class="c">// explicitly write the `self` that gets constructed when you call add_person</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">ref_to_arena</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">arena</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">// type &amp;'a Arena&lt;'?&gt;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">lonely</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Arena</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">add_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ref_to_arena</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"lonely"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nd">vec!</span><span class="p">[]);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember the second rule I listed earlier?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> methods should all receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena self</code>, i.e. their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> type is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We followed this rule; the signature of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_person</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn add_person(&amp;'arena self)</code>. This means that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref_to_arena</code> is <em>forced</em> to have a lifetime that matches the pattern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'arena Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code>. Currently its lifetime is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;'a Arena&lt;'?&gt;</code>, which means that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'?</code> is <em>forced</em> to be the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a</code>, i.e. the lifetime of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arena</code> variable itself. If the lifetime weren’t invariant, the compiler would be able to squeeze other lifetimes to fit, but it is invariant, and the unconstrained lifetime is forced to be exactly one lifetime.</p>

<p>And by this rather subtle sleight of hand we’re able to force the compiler to set the lifetime <em>parameter</em> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> to the lifetime of its <em>instance</em>.</p>

<p>After this, the rest is pretty straightforward. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena&lt;'arena&gt;</code> holds entries of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person&lt;'arena&gt;</code>, which is basically a way of saying “a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> that is allowed to reference items of lifetime <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code>, i.e. items in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code>”. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type PersonRef&lt;'arena&gt; = &amp;'arena Person&lt;'arena&gt;</code> is a convenient shorthand for “a reference to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> that lives in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code> and is allowed to reference objects from it”.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-destructors">What about destructors?</h3>

<p>So a thing I’ve not covered so far is how this can be safe in the presence of destructors. If your arena is allowed to have cyclic references, and you write a destructor reading from those cyclic references, whichever participant in the cycle that is deleted later on will have dangling references.</p>

<p>This gets to a <em>really</em> obscure part of Rust, even more obscure than variance. You almost never need to really understand this, beyond “explicit destructors subtly change borrow check behavior”. But it’s useful to know to get a better mental model of what’s going on here.</p>

<p>If we add the following code to our arena example:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">impl</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'arena</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Drop</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">'arena</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="k">drop</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"goodbye {:?}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="py">.name</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">friend</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="py">.reverse_follows</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="c">// potentially dangling!</span>
            <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\t\t</span><span class="s">{}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">friend</span><span class="py">.name</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>we actually get this error:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The presence of destructors subtly changes the behavior of the borrow checker around self-referential lifetimes. The exact rules are tricky and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/dropck.html">explained in the nomicon</a>, but <em>essentially</em> what happened was that the existence of a custom destructor on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person&lt;'arena&gt;</code> made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> (and thus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arena</code>) a lifetime which is “observed during destruction”. This is then taken into account during borrow checking – suddenly the implicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drop()</code> at the end of the scope is known to be able to read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code> data, and Rust makes the appropriate conclusion that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drop()</code> will be able to read things after they’ve been cleaned up, since destruction is itself a mutable operation, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drop()</code> is run interspersed in it.</p>

<p>Of course, a reasonable question to ask is how we can store things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FrozenVec</code> in this arena if destructors aren’t allowed to “wrap” types with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'arena</code>. The reason is that Rust knows that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> <em>cannot</em> inspect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person.follows</code> because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code> does not even know what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> is, and has promised to never try and find out. This wouldn’t necessarily be true if we had a random generic type since the destructor can call trait methods (or specialized blanket methods) which <em>do</em> know how to read the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, but in such a case the subtly changed borrow checker rules would kick in again. The stdlib types and other custom datastructures achieve this with an escape hatch, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/dropck.html#an-escape-hatch"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[may_dangle]</code></a> (also known as “the eyepatch”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">5</a></sup>), which allows you to pinky swear that you won’t be reading from a lifetime or generic parameter in a custom destructor.</p>

<p>This applies to crates like <a href="https://docs.rs/typed-arena/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed-arena</code></a> as well; if you are creating cycles you will not be able to write custom destructors on the types you put in the arena. You <em>can</em> write custom destructors with <a href="https://docs.rs/typed-arena/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed-arena</code></a> as long as you refrain from mutating things in ways that can create cycles; so you will not be able to use interior mutability to have one arena entry point to another.</p>

      <p>You may wonder how it is safe for destructors to be safely run on cyclic references – after all, the destructor of whichever entry gets destroyed second will be able to read a dangling reference.

    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2021/02/22/integrating-rust-and-c-plus-plus-in-firefox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was originally drafted in August 2018, but I never got around to finishing it. As such, parts of its framing (e.g. the focus on bindgen) are outdated, given the relative infancy of the interop space at the time. I was recently told that the post is still useful in this form so I decided to finish and publish it anyway, while attempting to mark outdated things as such when I notice them. Everything after the allocators section was written near the time of publication.</em></p>

<p>In 2017 I worked on the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">Stylo</a> project, uplifting Servo’s CSS engine (“style system”) into Firefox’s browser engine
(“Gecko”). This involved a <em>lot</em> of gnarly FFI between Servo’s Rust codebase and Firefox’s C++ codebase. There were a
lot of challenges in doing this, and I feel like it’s worth sharing things from our experiences.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in Rust integrations, you may find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9acx2zgx4Q">this talk by Katharina on Rust - C++ FFI</a>, and <a href="https://hsivonen.fi/modern-cpp-in-rust/">this blog post by Henri on integrating encoding-rs into Firefox</a> useful as well.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-this-post-for">Who is this post for?</h2>

<p>So, first off the bat, I’ll mention that when integrating Rust into a C++ codebase, you
want to <em>avoid</em> having integrations as tight as Stylo. Don’t do what we did; make your Rust
component mostly self-contained so that you just have to maintain something like ten FFI functions
for interacting with it. If this is possible to do, you should do it and your life will be <em>much</em> easier. Pick a clean API boundary, define a straightforward API, use cbindgen or bindgen if necessary without any tricks, and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>That said, sometimes you <em>have</em> to have gnarly integrations, and this blog post is for those use cases.
These techniques mostly use bindgen in their examples, however you can potentially use them with hand-rolled bindings or another tool as well. If you’re at this level of complexity, however, the potential for mistakes in the hand-rolled bindings is probably not worth it.</p>

<p><em>Note from 2021: <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is probably a better tool for many of the use cases here, though many of the techniques still transfer.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-was-involved-in-stylos-ffi">What was involved in Stylo’s FFI?</h2>

<p>So, what made Stylo’s FFI so complicated?</p>

<p>It turns out that browsers are quite monolithic. You can split them into vaguely-defined components, but
these components are still tightly integrated. If you intend to replace a component, you may need to
make a jagged edge of an integration surface.</p>

<p>The style system is more self-contained than other parts, but it’s still quite tightly integrated.</p>

<p>The main job of a “style system” is to take the CSS rules and DOM tree, and run them through “the cascade”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
with an output of “computed styles” tagged on each node in the tree. So, for example, it will take a document like
the following:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;style </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">12px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nt">div</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nl">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">2em</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/style&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and turn it into something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12px</code>, everything else is the default</li>
  <li>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#foo</code> has a computed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">24px</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, everything else is the default. It “inherits” the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-size</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12px</code></li>
</ul>

<p>From a code point of view, this means that Stylo takes in Gecko’s C++ DOM tree. It parses all the CSS,
and then runs the cascade on the tree. It stores computed styles on each element in a way that Gecko can read
very cheaply.</p>

<p>Style computation can involve some complex steps that require calling back into C++ code. Servo’s style system
is multithreaded, but Gecko is mostly designed to work off of a single main thread per process, so we need to
deal with this impedence mismatch.</p>

<p>Since the output of Stylo is C++-readable structs, Stylo needs to be able to read and write nontrivial C++
abstractions. Typical FFI involves passing values over a boundary, never to be seen again, however here we’re
dealing with persistent state that is accessed by both sides.</p>

<p>To sum up, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lots and lots of back-and-forth FFI</li>
  <li>Thread safety concerns</li>
  <li>Rust code regularly dealing with nontrivial C++ abstractions</li>
  <li>A need for nontrivial abstractions to be passed over FFI</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this conspires to make for some really complicated FFI code.</p>

<h1 id="the-actual-techniques">The actual techniques</h1>

<p>I’ll try to structure this so that the more broadly useful (and/or less gnarly) techniques come earlier in the post.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics-of-bindgen">The basics of bindgen</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/">Bindgen</a> is a tool that generates Rust bindings for structs and functions from the provided C or C++ header files. It’s often used for writing Rust bindings to existing C/C++ libraries, however it’s useful for integrations as well.</p>

<p>To use it for an integration, write a header file containing the functions your Rust code needs (referencing structs from other header files if necessary), and <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/command-line-usage.html">run bindgen on it</a>. For some codebases, doing this once and
checking in the generate file suffices, but if your C++ code is going to change a lot, <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/tutorial-1.html">run it as a build dependency instead</a>. Beware that this can adversely impact build times, since your Rust build now has a partial
C++ compilation step.</p>

<p>For large C++ codebases, pulling in a single header will likely pull in a <em>lot</em> of stuff. You should <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/allowlisting.html">allowlist</a>, <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/blocklisting.html">blocklist</a>, and/or mark things as <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/opaque.html">opaque</a> to reduce the amount of bindings generated. It’s best to go the allowlisting route — give bindgen an allowlisted list of functions / structs to generate bindings for, and it will transitively generate bindings for any dependencies they may have. Sometimes even this will end up generating a lot, it’s sometimes worth finding structs you’re not using and marking them as opaque so that their bindings aren’t necessary. Marking something as opaque replaces it with an array of the appropriate size and alignment, so from the Rust side it’s just some bits you don’t care about and can’t introspect further.</p>

<p>Bindgen <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/cpp.html"><em>does</em> support some C++ features</a> (you may need to pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-x c++</code>). This is pretty good for generating bindings to e.g. templated structs. However, it’s not possible to support <em>all</em> C++ features here, so you may need to blocklist, opaqueify, or use intermediate types if you have some complicated C++ abstractions in the deps. You’ll typically get an error when generating bindings or when compiling the generated bindings, so don’t worry about this unless that happens.</p>

<p>Bindgen is <em>quite</em> configurable. Stylo has a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/components/style/build_gecko.rs">script</a> that consumes a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/ServoBindings.toml">large toml file</a> containing all of the configuration.</p>

<h2 id="cbindgen">cbindgen</h2>

<p>We don’t use <a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen">cbindgen</a> in Stylo, but it’s used for Webrender. It does the inverse of what bindgen does: given a Rust crate, it generates C headers for its public <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern "C"</code> API. It’s also quite configurable.</p>

<h2 id="cxx">cxx</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is the cool new hotness in 2021, which kind of approaches the problem from both sides, enabling you to write Rust bindings for C++ and C++ bindings for Rust. It’s definitely worth checking out, a lot of the things that are hard to make work with bindgen are trivial in cxx. For example, it automatically figures out what types need to be opaque, it automatically converts between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T*</code> across FFI, and it is overall more targeted for the use case of an FFI layer where Rust and C++ both call each other.</p>

<h2 id="bindgen-aided-c-calling-rust">Bindgen-aided C++ calling Rust</h2>

<p>So bindgen helps with creating things for Rust to call and manipulate, but not in the opposite direction. cbindgen can help here, but I’m not sure if it’s advisable to have <em>both</em> bindgen and cbindgen operating near each other on the same codebase.</p>

<p>In Stylo we use a bit of a hack for this. Firstly, all FFI functions defined in C++ that Rust calls are declared in <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindingList.h">one file</a>, and are all named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gecko_*</code>. Bindgen supports regexes for things like allowlisting, so this naming scheme makes it easy to deal with.</p>

<p>We also declare the FFI functions defined in Rust that C++ calls in <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindingList.h">another file</a>, named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Servo_*</code>. They’re also all <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/glue.rs">defined in one place</a>.</p>

<p>However, there’s nothing ensuring that the signatures match! If we’re not careful, there may be mismatches, causing bad things to happen at link time or runtime. We use a small <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/tests/build.rs">autogenerated</a> <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/tests/servo_function_signatures.rs">unit test</a> to ensure the validity of the signatures.</p>

<p>This is especially important as we do things like type replacement, and we need tests to ensure that the rug isn’t pulled out from underneath us.</p>

<h2 id="type-replacing-for-fun-and-profit">Type replacing for fun and profit</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/blocklisting.html">blocklisting</a> in conjunction with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--raw-line</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw_line()</code> flag, one can effectively ask bindgen to “replace” types. Blocklisting asks bindgen not to generate bindings for a type, however bindgen will continue to generate bindings <em>referring</em> to that type if necessary. (Unlike opaque types where bindgen generates an opaque binding for the type and uses it everywhere). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--raw-line</code> lets you request bindgen to add a line of raw rust code to the file, and such a line can potentially define or import a new version of the type you blocklisted. Effectively, this lets you replace types.</p>

<p>Bindgen generates unit tests ensuring that the layout of your structs is correct (run them!), so if you accidentally replace a type with something incompatible, you will get warnings at the struct level (functions may not warn).</p>

<p>There are various ways this can be used:</p>

<h3 id="safe-references-across-ffi">Safe references across FFI</h3>

<p><em>Note from 2021: <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> does this automatically</em></p>

<p>Calling into C++ (and accepting data from C++) is unsafe. However, there’s no reason we should have to worry about this more than we have to. For example, it would be nice if accessor FFI functions – functions which take a foreign object and return something from inside it –  could use lifetimes. It would be even nicer if nullability were represented on the FFI boundary so that you don’t miss null checks, and can assume non-nullness when the C++ API is okay with it.</p>

<p>In Stylo, we have lots of functions like the following:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">RawGeckoNodeBorrowedOrNull</span> <span class="nf">Gecko_GetLastChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RawGeckoNodeBorrowed</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which bindgen translates to:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">extern</span> <span class="s">"C"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">Gecko_GetLastChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">RawGeckoNode</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">Option</span><span class="o">&lt;&amp;</span><span class="n">RawGeckoNode</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span>   
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/components/style/build_gecko.rs">bindgen build script</a> on a provided <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindings.toml#648-671">list of borrow-able types</a>, we’ve told bindgen that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FooBorrowedOrNull</code> is actually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FooBorrowed</code> is actually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;Foo</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/repr-rust.html">is represented as a single nullable pointer in Rust</a>, so this is a clean translation. 
We’re forced to null-check it, but once we do we can safely assume that the reference is valid. Furthermore, due to lifetime elision the actual signature of the FFI function is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn Gecko_GetLastChild&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a RawGeckoNode) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'a RawGeckoNode&gt;</code>, which ensures we won’t let the returned reference outlive the passed reference. Lifetime elision means that we can call C++ functions “safely” with the appropriate lifetime requirements, even though C++ has no such concept!</p>

<p>Note that this is shifting some of the safety invariants to the C++ side: We rely on the C++ to give us valid references, and we rely on it to not have nulls when the type is not marked as nullable. Most C++ codebases internally rely on such invariants for safety anyway, so this isn’t much of a stretch.</p>

<p>We do this on both sides, actually: Many of our Rust-defined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extern "C"</code> functions that C++ calls get to be internally-safe because the types let us assume the validity of the pointers obtained from C++.</p>

<h3 id="making-c-abstractions-rust-accessible">Making C++ abstractions Rust-accessible</h3>

<p>A very useful thing to do here is to replace various C++ abstractions with Rust versions of them that share semantics. In Gecko, most strings are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsString</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsAString</code>/etc.</p>

<p>We’ve written an <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6ddb5fb144993fb5de044e2e8d900d7643b98a4d/servo/support/gecko/nsstring/src/lib.rs">nsstring</a> crate that represents layout-compatible <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsString</code>s in a more Rusty way, with Rusty APIs. We then ask bindgen to replace Gecko <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsString</code>s with these.</p>

<p>Usually it’s easier to just write an impl for the bindgen-generated abstraction, however sometimes you must replace it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the abstraction internally does a lot of template stuff not supported by bindgen</li>
  <li>When you want the code for the abstraction to be in a separate crate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="potential-pitfall-passing-c-classes-by-value-over-ffi">Potential pitfall: Passing C++ classes by-value over FFI</h2>

<p>It’s quite tempting to do stuff like</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">RefPtr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Servo_Gimme</span><span class="p">(...);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where you pass complicated classes by-value over FFI (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr</code> is Gecko’s variant of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>This works on some systems, but is broken on MSVC:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38258">The ABI for passing non-POD types through functions is different</a>. The linker usually notices this and complains, but it’s worth avoiding this entirely.</p>

<p>In Stylo we handle this by using some macro-generated intermediate types which are basically the same thing as the original class but without any constructors/destructors/operators. We convert to/from these types immediately before/after the FFI call, and on the Rust side we do similar conversions to Rust-compatible abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-abstractions-with-destructors">Sharing abstractions with destructors</h2>

<p>If you’re passing ownership of collections or other templated types across FFI, you probably want Rust code to be able to destroy C++ objects, and vice versa.</p>

<p>One way of doing this is to implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> on the generated struct. If you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class MyString</code>, you can do:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyString</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>

    <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">-&gt;~</span><span class="n">MyString</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">impl</span> <span class="n">Drop</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nn">bindings</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">MyString</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyString_Destroy</code> isn’t necessary with bindgen – bindgen will generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyString::destruct()</code> function for you – but be careful, this will make your generated bindings very platform-specific, so be sure to only do this if running them at build time. In general, when bindgen generates C++ <em>methods</em>, your bindings become platform specific and are best regenerated at build time<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In Stylo we went down the route of manually defining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_Destroy()</code> functions since we started off with checked-in platform-agnostic bindings, however we could probably switch to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destruct()</code> if we want to now.</p>

<p>When it comes to generic types, it’s a bit trickier, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> can’t be implemented piecewise on a generic type (you cannot <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impl Drop for MyVector&lt;Foo&gt;</code>). You have to do something like:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<p>Note that if you forget to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Drop</code> implementation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, this will silently forget to clean up the contents of the vector. See <a href="#mirror-types">the next section</a> for some ways to handle this by creating a “safe” mirror type.</p>

<h2 id="mirror-types">Mirror types</h2>

<p>C++ libraries often have useful templated abstractions, and it’s nice to be able to manipulate them from Rust. Sometimes, it’s possible to just tack on semantics on the Rust side (either by adding an implementation or by doing type replacement), but in some cases this is tricky.</p>

<p>For example, Gecko has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, except the actual refcounting logic is up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> to implement (it can choose between threadsafe, non-threadsafe, etc), which it does by writing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AddRef()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Release()</code> methods.</p>

<p>We mirror this in Rust by having a trait:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">/// Trait for all objects that have Addref() and Release</span>
<span class="c">/// methods and can be placed inside RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="k">trait</span> <span class="n">RefCounted</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">/// Bump the reference count.</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">addref</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="c">/// Decrease the reference count.</span>
    <span class="k">unsafe</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">release</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/// A custom RefPtr implementation to take into account Drop semantics and</span>
<span class="c">/// a bit less-painful memory management.</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCounted</code> trait for C++ types that are wrapped in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr</code> which we wish to access through Rust. We have <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/cfaa5a1d48d6bc6552199e73004ecb05d0a9c921/servo/components/style/gecko_bindings/sugar/refptr.rs#258-315">some</a> <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/cfaa5a1d48d6bc6552199e73004ecb05d0a9c921/layout/style/GeckoBindings.h#52-60">macros</a> that make this easier to do. We have to have such a trait, because otherwise Rust code wouldn’t know how to manage various C++ types.</p>

<p>However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> here can’t be the type that ends up being used in bindgen. Rust doesnt let us do things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impl&lt;T: RefCounted&gt; Drop for RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, so we can’t effectively make this work with the bindgen generated type unless we write a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCounted</code> implementation for every refcounted type that shows up in the bindgen output at all – which would be a lot of work.</p>

<p>Instead, we let bindgen generate its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code>, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">structs::RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> (all the structs that bindgen generates for Gecko go in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">structs::</code> module). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">structs::RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> itself doesn’t have enough semantics to be something we can pass around willy-nilly in Rust code without causing leaks. However, it has <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/cfaa5a1d48d6bc6552199e73004ecb05d0a9c921/servo/components/style/gecko_bindings/sugar/refptr.rs#150-234">some methods</a> that allow for conversion into the “safe” mirror <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> (but only if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T: RefCounted</code>). So if you need to manipulate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> in a C++ struct somewhere, you immediately use one of the conversion methods to get a safe version of it first, and <em>then</em> do things to it. Refcounted types that don’t have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCounted</code> implementation won’t have conversion methods: they may exist in the data you’re manipulating, however you won’t be able to work with them.</p>

<p>In general, whenever attaching extra semantics to generic bindgen types doesn’t work create a mirror type that’s completely safe to use from Rust, with a trait that gates conversion to the mirror type.</p>

<h2 id="potential-pitfall-allocators">Potential pitfall: Allocators</h2>

<p>If you’re passing heap-managed abstractions across FFI, be careful about which code frees which objects. If your Rust
and C++ code don’t share allocators, deallocating memory allocated on the other side can have disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>If you’re building a cdylib or staticlib with Rust (this is likely if you’re linking it with a C++ application), the compiler will by default pick the system allocator (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">malloc</code>), so if your C++ application also uses the same you’re all set.</p>

<p>On some platforms when building rlibs and binaries, Rust may choose jemalloc instead. It’s also possible that your C++ code uses a different allocator (lots of applications use allocators like jemalloc or tcmalloc, some have their own custom allocators like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tor_malloc</code> in Tor).</p>

<p>In such cases you have one of three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid transferring ownership of heap-allocated items, only share things as borrowed references</li>
  <li>Call destructors over FFI, as detailed in <a href="#sharing-abstractions-with-destructors">the section on destructors above</a></li>
  <li>Set Rust’s allocator to be the same as documented <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/alloc/#the-global_allocator-attribute">in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::alloc</code> module</a>. Basically, can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[global_allocator]</code> attribute to select which allocator you wish to use, and if necessary you can implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GlobalAlloc</code> trait on a custom allocator type that calls into whatever custom allocator C++ is using.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note from 2021: Most stdlib collections (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code></a>, for example) now have an optional “custom allocator” parameter that can be used to swap in a different allocator for a specific use site.</em></p>

<h2 id="arcs-over-ffi-triomphe">Arcs over FFI: Triomphe</h2>

<p>This isn’t really a generalizable technique, but it’s pretty cool and generally instructive, so I’m including it here.</p>

<p>Stylo uses a lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code>s. A <em>lot</em> of them. The entire computation of styles makes heavy use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc::make_mut</code>’s copy-on-write semantics so that we can build up the style tree in parallel but not have to make unnecessary copies of duplicated/defaulted styles for each element.</p>

<p>Many of these <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code>s need to be readable from C++. Rust’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code>, however, consists of a pointer to an allocation containing a refcount and the data, so if C++ needs to get access to the data it needs to know the layout of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code> allocation, which we’d rather not do<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We picked a different route: We created a crate duplicating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> which behaves almost exactly the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, but it can be converted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OffsetArc&lt;T&gt;</code> which has its pointer point to the <em>middle</em> of the allocation, where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> begins. To C++, this just looks like a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*const T</code>! We were then able to make it work with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> on the C++ side so that C++ can transparently read from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OffsetArc&lt;T&gt;</code>, and only needs to call into Rust if it wishes to clone or drop it.</p>

<p>The external version of this crate can be found in <a href="https://docs.rs/triomphe">triomphe</a>. It contains a bunch of other goodies that are additionally useful outside of the FFI world, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArcBorrow</code> which is essentially “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> without double indirection”, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueArc&lt;T&gt;</code>, a mutable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> known to be uniquely owned, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArcUnion&lt;T, U&gt;</code>, which is a space-efficient union of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc&lt;U&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2 id="other-pitfalls">Other pitfalls</h2>

<h3 id="transparent">Transparent</h3>

<p>It’s <em>very</em> tempting to wrap C++ types in tuple structs and pass them over FFI. For example, one might imagine that the following is okay:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nf">Wrapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">bindings</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">SomeCppType</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">extern</span> <span class="s">"C"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">// C++ signature: `SomeCppType get_cpp_type();`</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">get_cpp_type</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Wrapper</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This kind of thing is quite useful to get around coherence, or for adding additional semantics to a type.</p>

<p>While there’s basically one obvious way <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wrapper</code> can be represented, ABI stuff can be tricky, and Rust’s layout isn’t defined. It is safer to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[repr(transparent)]</code>, which guarantees that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wrapper</code> will have the same representation as the type it contains.</p>

<h3 id="c-enums">C enums</h3>

<p>Rust supports C-like enums, but there’s a crucial difference between them. In C, it is not undefined behavior for an enum to have an unlisted value. In fact, the following pattern is not uncommon:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Flags</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Flag1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">b0001</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">Flag2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">b0010</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">Flag3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">b0100</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">Flag4</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">b1000</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where the enum is actually used for bitflags, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Flag1 | Flag2</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> are both valid values for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Flags</code>.</p>

<p>This is not the case in Rust. If you are type-replacing C enums with Rust ones, make sure they are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[repr(C)]</code>. The Rust compiler uses invalid enum values as space for packing other information while optimizing types, for example Rust is able to represent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option&lt;Option&lt;... 255 times .. Option&lt;bool&gt;&gt;</code> as a single byte.</p>

<p>If you are working with a C enum that is used for bitflags like above, please use an integer type instead. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[repr(C)]</code> on enums in Rust guarantees layout, but it is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/other-reprs.html">still undefined behavior for any enum to take on invalid values</a>.</p>

<h3 id="abi-concerns">ABI concerns</h3>

<p>ABIs can be tricky. If you <em>just</em> use bindgen with no special flags, you can be pretty much guaranteed to have an okay ABI, but as you start doing type replacements, stuff can get murkier.</p>

<p>Firstly, make sure you’re not passing owned C++ classes with destructors/etc across FFI boundaries. See <a href="#potential-pitfall-passing-c-classes-by-value-over-ffi">above</a> for why. There’s a bunch of subtle stuff here, but you can avoid most of it it if you just don’t pass these things across FFI in an owned way.</p>

<p>Also, try to make sure everything is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[repr(C)]</code> across the boundary. Rust’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improper-ctypes</code> lints will help here.</p>

<h2 id="should-c-apis-be-unconditionally-unsafe">Should C++ APIs be unconditionally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code>?</h2>

<p>Before I get into this, I want to reiterate that most of the recommendations in this post are for <em>complex</em> C++-Rust integrations, which are likely to only crop up when attempting to rewrite parts of a large C++ codebase in Rust. Such codebases have unique needs and it’s important to calibrate for that when judging what’s right for them.</p>

<p>I recall when <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/rust-and-c-interoperability">this Chromium post</a> and <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/the-cxx-debate">Steve’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cxx</code> post</a> came out, there was a bunch of discussion about C++ functions not being universally marked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code>. Essentially, a lot of people are of the opinion that all FFI into C++ (or C) should be unconditionally marked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> (and that tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cxx</code> should follow these rules).</p>

<p>Back then I wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ielvxu/the_cxx_debate/g2jurb3/?context=3">a Reddit comment</a> about my thoughts on this. It’s a comment that’s the length of a blog post in and of itself so I’m not going to reproduce all of it here, but I’ll try to get the gist. I highly suggest you read it instead of this section.</p>

<p>In short, I would recommend people in large, complex codebases doing heavy C++ interop to generally be okay with marking functions calling into C++ as “safe” provided that function would be considered “safe to call without thinking too much about it” on the C++ side, whatever that means for your codebase.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/12/24/undefined-vs-unsafe-in-rust/">my post on “undefined” vs “unsafe”</a>, for Rust I define “safe” as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, in Rust a bit of code is “safe” if it cannot exhibit undefined behavior under all circumstances of that code being used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C++ doesn’t have a rigid language-level concept of safety that can be applied the same way. Instead, most C++ code follows a similar heuristic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a bit of code is “safe” if it cannot exhibit undefined behavior under all <strong>expected</strong> circumstances of that code being used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, perhaps, not as good or useful a heuristic as the one we have for Rust, but it’s still a heuristic that gets used in deciding how careful one needs to be when using various APIs. After all, there are <em>plenty</em> of giant C++ codebases out there, they have got to be able to reason about safety <em>somehow</em>.</p>

<p>When you decide to meld together a C++ and Rust codebase, or start rewriting parts of a C++ codebase in Rust, you have already in essence decided for a large part of the codebase to not exactly follow Rust’s safety rules (but hopefully still be safe). There is little to be gained by making that an explicit part of your FFI boundary. Rather, it is more useful to save <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> on the FFI boundary for truly unsafe functions which you actually do need to be careful to call.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> is useful for finding potential sources of badness in your codebase. For a tightly-integrated Rust/C++ codebase it’s already well known that the C++-side is introducing badness, marking every simple C++ getter as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> will lead to alarm fatigue and make it <em>harder</em> to find the real problems.</p>

<p>It’s worth figuring out where this boundary lies for you. Tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cxx</code> make it straightforward to call C++ functions through a safe interface, and it’s valuable to make use of that support.</p>

<h2 id="closing-comments">Closing comments</h2>

<p>Again, before going down this route it’s worth wondering if you <em>really</em> need tight Rust-C++ integration. When possible, it’s always better to pick a small, well-defined API boundary, rather than Stylo-esque tight integration with shared objects and a highly criscrossed callgraph.</p>

<p>These days <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is probably the most complete tool for such integrations. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/">bindgen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen">cbindgen</a> are still quite good, but cxx is C++-first, with a lot more magic, and generally seems to Just Work without too much configuration.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/autocxx">autocxx</a> is a cool concept by Adrian Taylor which melds bindgen and cxx to make something even <em>more</em> magical. It’s currently experimental, but I’m going to be watching it with interest.</p>

<p>Overall the field of Rust and C++ integration is at a stage where it’s mature enough for integrations to be <em>possible</em> without too much effort, but there are still tons of ways things could be improved and I’m super excited to see that happen as more people work on such integrations!</p>

    <updated>2019-10-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2019/10/09/on-voting-systems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Election season is starting up again, and as with many other topics I’m seeing a lot of overconfident takes from people in tech wanting to “solve” how voting works with naïve techy solutions. Hell, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/andrew-yang-wants-to-make-us-elections-fraud-proof-using-blockchain">even a presidential candidate seems to have proposed an extremely uninformed plan for “fixing” voting using blockchain technology</a>.</p>

<p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1056255900095340545">a thread on Twitter</a> covering some of the essential properties good voting systems uphold as well as how they prevent fraud. It was through the lens of Alameda County’s voting system, where I’ve volunteered as a poll worker in the past (and intend to do again). I’ve been meaning to write down the contents of that thread in blog form for a while, and now seemed like a good opportunity to do it.</p>

<p>I’ll be explaining more about most of these properties later, but ideally, a good voting system should uphold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Secret ballot: Nobody, not even you, can verify who you voted for after you’re out of the polling place, to prevent vote-buying and coercion.</li>
  <li>Auditable paper trail: We should be able to audit the election. Paper trails are usually the most robust way to enable effective audits.</li>
  <li>Obviousness: It should be relatively obvious what individuals should be doing when they need to mark their ballots. A system that you can easily “mess up” with is a bad system.</li>
  <li>Accessibility: It should not exclude individuals with disabilities from being able to vote.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-voting-works-in-alameda-county">How voting works in Alameda County</h2>

<p>I’ll first go over how voting in my county works. The system isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty good, and it’s a good springboard for understanding how voting systems in general can work. There’s a <a href="https://www.acvote.org/acvote-assets/04_resources/PDFs/pwmanuals/06042019/Guide-FINAL-june.pdf">poll worker guide</a> you can refer to if you’re really interested in all the specifics.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are four ways to vote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By mail</li>
  <li>In person at certain government offices, before election day (“early voting”)</li>
  <li>In person on election day at a polling place</li>
  <li>Provisionally, in person on election day at a polling place</li>
</ul>

<p>Voting by mail is pretty straightforward: When you register you can choose to vote by mail (or you can choose to do so online after the fact). You get a ballot in the mail, along with a special envelope. You fill in the ballot at your leisure, stick it in the envelope, write your name/address on the envelope, sign it, and mail it back. There are also convenient ballot dropboxes all over the place in case you’re a millenial like me and don’t want to figure out how to buy stamps<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If you’re voting by mail you can also show up at any polling place on the day of the election and drop off your ballots in a sealed bin. At the polling place I helped run roughly half of the people coming in were just there to drop off their vote by mail ballots!</p>

<p>Voting by mail is by far the easiest option here. Sadly not all counties support it<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. In some states <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote-by-mail_in_Oregon">this is even the <em>default</em> option</a>.</p>

<p>As I understand it, voting in person at designated government offices<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> is pretty much the same as voting in person at a polling place, it’s just run by government employees instead of volunteers and open for a few weeks before election day.</p>

<figure class="caption-wrapper center" style="width: 400px"><img class="caption" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/post/polls/bling.jpeg" width="400" /><figcaption class="caption-text"><p>Poll workers are given some neat bling to wear</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="in-person-voting">In person voting</h3>

<p>If you’ve chosen to vote in person, you are supposed to turn up at your assigned polling place (you get your assignment in the mail along with other voter info booklets).</p>

<p>There’s a copy of the list of people assigned to the polling place posted outside, and another with the poll workers inside. When you tell your name to the poll workers, they cross your name off the list, and you have to sign your name next to it<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your name isn’t on the list, the poll workers will try and find your assigned precinct and inform you that you can go there instead, but you can still choose to vote provisionally at the existing precinct.</li>
  <li>If your name isn’t on the list of all voters (perhaps you registered very late, or were unable to register), you can also vote provisionally.</li>
  <li>If your name is on the list but marked as voting-by-mail (and you want to vote in person), you can vote normally only if you surrender your mail ballot (which poll workers will mark as spoiled and put in a separate pouch).</li>
  <li>If you lost/didn’t receive your ballot, you can always vote provisionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are voting normally, signing your name on the list fraudulently is illegal.</p>

<p>If it is your first time voting, you need to show some form of ID, but it doesn’t need to be photo ID and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act#Voter_identification">even a utility bill is fine</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’re done signing, you’ll be given your ballot cards and a privacy sleeve folder so you can carry your filled ballots around. Because this is California and there are tons of local and state measures, we had 4 (!!) ballot cards, six sides to fill in<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. Usually a poll worker will also detach the ballot stubs in front of you and hand them to you to keep. You can use these to check the status (but not the contents!) of your ballot online.</p>

<p>You take your cards to a voting booth, fill them in, and come back. A poll worker will then help you feed your ballot cards into a scanner machine. This machine will reject cards with any problems — which you can fix, rerequesting new ballot cards if necessary, but you then have to spoil and return the old ballot card.</p>

<p>The machine keeps an externally-visible tally of the number of ballots submitted, and an internal tally of all the votes made, ignoring write-ins. It also internally stores ballot cards in one of two bins (depending on write-ins). These bins are verified to be empty when polls open, and are inaccessible till polls close.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the scanner is not a load-bearing component of the system: It could be replaced with a locked bin with a slot, and the system would still work. The scanner enables one to get <em>preliminary</em> results for the precinct, and provides a way to double-check results.</p>

<p>And that’s it! You’ll be given an I Voted sticker, and you can go home!</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="using-a-voting-machine">Using a voting machine</h3>

<p>In case you think you will have trouble filling out a ballot card in pen (e.g. if your vision is heavily impared), there’s an alternate way to vote that doesn’t involve a pen. Instead, we have a machine which has a touchscreen and an audio unit, which prompts the voter for their selection for each ballot item on the touchscreen or audio unit. When they’re done, the machine will print out a “receipt” listing their choices inside a sealed box with a glass window, so they can verify that their vote was recorded correctly<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. Once they’re done the sealed box will scroll the “receipt” out of view so that the next voter can’t see it.</p>

<p>The sealed box is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter-verified_paper_audit_trail">Voter-Verified Paper Trail</a> box: the election runners no longer need to trust the machine’s internal memory, they can trust the paper trail inside the box (which, while produced by a potentially-untrustworthy machine, was verified by the voters), and the machine’s internal memory is simply a way to double-check (and get fast preliminary results).</p>

<h3 id="provisional-voting">Provisional voting</h3>

<p>There are many, many situations in which you may not be able to vote normally. Perhaps you showed up at the wrong precinct but don’t have time to go to the right one. Perhaps you were signed up for vote-by-mail but didn’t receive (or lost) your ballot. Perhaps you recently moved into the county and weren’t able to register in time. Perhaps you were a first-time in-person voter and didn’t have some form of ID.</p>

<p>In such a case you can always vote provisionally. The beauty of this system is that it removes most liability from poll workers: we don’t have any reason to turn people away from the polls, all we can do is refuse to let people vote normally (and instead vote provisionally) in the case of any inconsistencies. This is not to say that malicious poll workers <em>can’t</em> turn people away; it’s illegal but it happens. But well-meaning poll workers cannot, by accident, disenfranchise a voter because we are always allowed to give them a provisional ballot, and that’s an easy rule to follow.</p>

<p>With provisional voting, the voters are given the same ballot cards, but they’re also given an envelope with a form on it. This envelope is equivalent to a voter registration form, (re)registering them in their appropriate county/district<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>. They vote on the ballot cards normally, but instead of submitting the ballots to the scanner, they put them in the envelope, which goes into a sealed bin<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>. You’re also given a number you can call to check the status of your ballot.</p>

<p>When you vote provisionally, the registrar of voters will manually process your envelope, remaking your ballot on the right set of cards if necessary, and feeding them into a scanner machine.</p>

<h3 id="integrity-checks">Integrity checks</h3>

<p>Underlying this system is a bevy of integrity checks. There’s an intricate seal system, with numbered seals of varying colors. Some are to be added and never removed, some are to be removed after checking the number, some are never supposed to be touched, some are added at the beginning of the day and removed at the end of the day.</p>

<p>For example, during setup we check that the bins in the scanner are empty, and seal it with a numbered seal. This number is noted down on a form, along with some numbers from the scanner/touchscreen display. The first person to vote is asked to verify all this, and signs the form along with the poll workers.</p>

<p>Election officials drop in multiple times during the day, and may check these numbers. At the end of the day, the numbers of all seals used, and any physical seals that were removed are sent back along with all the ballots.</p>

<p>Various ballot counts are also kept track of. We keep track of the number of provisional ballots, the number of submitted regular ballots (also kept track by the scanner), the number of ballot cards used, and the number of unused ballots left over. Everything needs to match up at the end of the day, and all unused ballots are sent back. These counts are also noted down.</p>

<p>Poll watchers are allowed to be around for most of this, though I think they’re not allowed to <em>touch</em> anything. I think poll watchers are also allowed to be around when the actual ballots are being counted by election officials.</p>

<h3 id="immediate-local-results">Immediate local results</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, the scanner isn’t a crucial part of the system, but if it happens to be working it can be used to get immediate local results. At the end of the day, the scanner prints out a bunch of stuff, including vote totals for races which got more than N votes (N=20, IIRC), so you get immediate results for your precinct. This printout is supposed to be taped to the polling place doors for everyone to see, and presumably the registrar of voters uses the copy submitted to them to publish quick preliminary results.</p>

<p>Using paper ballots doesn’t mean that we have to give up all the benefits of computers doing some of the work for us! We can still use computers to get fast results, without relying on them for the integrity of the system.</p>

<figure class="caption-wrapper center" style="width: 400px"><img class="caption" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/post/polls/totals.jpeg" width="400" /><figcaption class="caption-text"><p>Vote totals posted outside. Our ballots are big and have lots of races on them; so the list of vote totals is absolutely ginormous.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="properties-of-this-voting-system">Properties of this voting system</h2>

<p>This system has some crucial properties.</p>

<h3 id="secret-ballot">Secret ballot</h3>

<p>It’s well known that nobody is supposed to be able to see who you voted for. But a crucial part of this system is that, once you submit your ballots, <em>you</em> can’t see who you voted for either. Of course, you probably can <em>remember</em>, but you have no <em>proof</em>. On the face of it this sounds like a bad property — wouldn’t it be nicer if people could verify that their vote was counted correctly?</p>

<p>The problem is that if <em>I</em> can verify that my vote was counted correctly, someone else can coerce me into doing this in front of them to ensure I voted a certain way. Any system that gives me the ability to verify my vote gives people who have power over me (or just people who want to buy my vote) the same ability.</p>

<p>Provisional voting doesn’t quite have this property, but it’s supposed to be for edge cases. Vote by mail trades off some of this property for convenience; people can now see who you voted for while you’re voting (and the people you live with can fradulently vote on your behalf, too).</p>

<h3 id="conservation-of-ballots-auditable-paper-trail">Conservation of ballots (Auditable paper trail)</h3>

<p>The total number of ballots in the system is roughly conserved and kept track of. If you’re registered to vote by mail, you cannot request a normal ballot without surrendering your vote by mail ballot and envelope (which we mark as spoiled and put in a separate pouch). If you re-request a ballot card because you made a mistake, the old card needs to be similarly spoiled and put away separately. It’s one set of ballot cards per voter, and almost all potential aberrations in this property result in a provisional vote<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>. Even provisional votes are converted to normal ballot cards in the end.</p>

<p>Eventually, there will be a giant roomful of ballots that cannot be traced back to their individual voters, but it can still be traced back to the <em>entirety</em> of the voters — it’s hard to put a ballot into the system without a corresponding voter. This is perfect — the ballots can be hand-counted, but they can’t be individually corellated with their respective voters.</p>

<p>You don’t even need to recount the entire set of ballots to perform an audit, <a href="https://risklimitingaudits.org/">risk limiting audits</a> are quite effective and much more efficient to carry out.</p>

<h3 id="paper-ballots">Paper ballots</h3>

<p>The fact that they can (and should) be hand counted is itself an important property. Hand counting of ballots can be independently verified in ways that can’t be done for software. Despite not being able to trace a ballot back to its voter, there still is a paper trail of integrity for the ballots as a bulk unit.</p>

<p>This property leads to [software independance]: while we may use software in the process, it’s not possible for a bug in the software to cause an undetectable error in the final vote counts.</p>

<figure class="caption-wrapper center" style="width: 500px"><img class="caption" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/post/polls/totals-zoom.png" width="500" /><figcaption class="caption-text"><p>Specific vote totals for the top races</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="obviousness">Obviousness</h3>

<p>Figuring out what to do in the voting booth isn’t hard. You’re allowed to request assistance, but you’ll rarely have to. There are systems (like the scanner’s error checking) that are designed to ensure you don’t mess up, but the system is quite sound even without them; they just provide an additional buffer.</p>

<p>Compare this with <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/01/texas-straight-ticket-voting-problems-old-machines/">the problems some Texas voting machines had last midterm</a>. The machines were somewhat buggy, but, crucially, there was an opaque right and wrong way to use them, and some voters accidentally used it the wrong way, and then didn’t check the final page before submitting. This kind of thing should never happen in a good voting system.</p>

<p>It’s really important that the system is intuitive and hard to make mistakes in.</p>

<h2 id="fraud-prevention">Fraud prevention</h2>

<p>So, how is this robust against fraud?</p>

<p>Firstly, voter fraud isn’t a major problem in the US, and it’s often used as an excuse to propagate voter suppression tactics, which <em>are</em> a major problem here.</p>

<p>But even then, we probably want our system to be robust against fraud.</p>

<p>Let’s see how an individual might thwart this system. They could vote multiple times, under assumed identites. This doesn’t scale well and isn’t really worth it: to influence an election you’d need to do this many times, or have many individuals do it a couple times, and the chance of getting caught (e.g., the people who you are voting as may come by and try to vote later, throwing up a flag) and investigated scales exponentially with the number of votes. That’s not worth it at all.</p>

<p>Maybe poll workers could do something malicious. Poll worker manipulation would largely exist in the form of submitting extra ballots. But that’s hard because the ballot counts need to match the list of voters. So you have the same problem as individual voters committing fraud: if the actual voter shows up, they’ll notice. Poll workers <em>could</em> wait till the end of the day to do this, but then to make any kind of difference you’d have to do a bulk scan of ballots, and that’s very noticeable. Poll workers would have to collude to make anything like this work, and poll watchers (and government staff) may be present.</p>

<p>Poll workers can also <em>discard</em> ballots to influence an election. But you can’t do this in front of the voters, and the receptacles with non-defaced ballots are all sealed so you can’t do this when nobody is watching without having to re-seal (which means you need a new numbered seal, which the election office will notice). The scanner’s inner receptacle is opened at the end of the day but you can’t tamper with that without messing up the various counts.</p>

<p>Election officials have access to giant piles of ballots and could mess with things there, but I suspect poll watchers are present during the ballot sorting and counting process, and again, it’s hard to tamper with anything without messing up the various counts.</p>

<p>Overall, this system is pretty robust. It’s important to note that fraud prevention is achieved by more social means, not technical means: there are seals, counts, and various properties of the system, but no computers involved in any crucial roles.</p>

<h2 id="techy-solutions-for-voting">Techy solutions for voting</h2>

<p>In general, amongst the three properties of “secret ballot”, “obviousness”, and “auditable paper trail”, computer-based voting systems almost always fail at one, and usually fail at two.</p>

<p>A lot of naïve tech solutions for voting are explicitly designed to not have the secret ballot property: they are instead designed specifically to let voters check that what their vote was counted as after the election. As mentioned earlier, this is a problem for vote-buying and coercion.</p>

<p>It’s theoretically possible to have a system where you can ensure your ballot, specifically, was correctly counted after the election, without losing the secret ballot property: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot">ThreeBallot</a> is a cool example of such a system, though it fails the “obviousness” property.</p>

<p>Most systems end up not having an auditable paper trail since they rely on machines to record votes. This is vulnerable to bugs in the machine: you end up having to trust the output of the machine. Buggy/vulnerable voting machines are so common that every year at DEFCON <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/voting-village-report-defcon27.pdf">people get together to hack the latest voting machines, and typically succeed</a>.</p>

<p>Voting machines can still produce a paper trail: Voter-Verified Paper Trail systems partially succeed in doing this. They’re not as good with maintaining the “conservation of ballots” property that makes tampering much harder, and they’re not as good on the “obviousness” part since people need to check the VVPAT box for what their vote was recorded as.</p>

<p>Ballot-Marking devices are a bit better at this: These still produce paper ballots, it’s just that the ballot is marked by the machine on your behalf. There’s still a bit of an “obviousness” fail in that people may not double check the marked ballot, but at least there’s a nice paper trail with ballot conservation! Of course, these only work if the produced ballot is easily human-readable.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>impossible</em> to design good voting systems that rely on technology, but it’s hard to maintain the same properties you can with paper ballots. If you want to try, please keep the properties listed above in mind.</p>

<h3 id="blockchain">Blockchain?</h3>

<p>Every now and then people will suggest using blockchains for voting. This is a pretty large design space, but …. most of these proposals are <em>extremely</em> naïve and achieve very little.</p>

<p>For one, most of them are of the category that lose the “secret ballot” property, instead producing some kind of identifier you’re able to check in some published blockchain. This lets you see what your vote was after the election, and as I’ve covered already that’s not a good thing.</p>

<p>Even if this process only lets you verify that your vote was counted (but not what it was), it typically involves some understanding of cryptography to spot-check the validity of the machine output (e.g. you need to verify that some hash is the hash of your actual vote or something). This fails the obviousness property.</p>

<p>Blockchains don’t really bring much to the table here. They’re decent for byzantine fault tolerance in a space without a central authority, but elections <em>do</em> have some form of central authority and we’re not getting rid of that. The anonymity properties of blockchains can usually be achieved without blockchains for things like elections.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of cryptography that can be useful for auditability — zero knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption come to mind — but you don’t need blockchains to use these, and using these still requires some form of technology as a key part of the voting system and this makes other properties of the system harder to achieve.</p>

<h2 id="become-a-poll-worker">Become a poll worker!</h2>

<p>It’s still a bit early for the next election, but I highly recommend you volunteer to be a poll worker for your county if you can!</p>

<p>It’s really fun, you get to learn about the inner workings of voting systems, and you get to meet a lot of people!</p>

    <link href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2019/02/04/rust-governance-scaling-empathy/"/>
    <updated>2019-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2019/02/04/rust-governance-scaling-empathy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s been a lot of talk about improving Rust’s governance model lately. As we decompress from last year’s hectic edition work, we’re slowly starting to look at all the bits of <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1073088515041198080">debt</a> we accumulated, and <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/">organizational debt</a> is high on that list.</p>

<p>I’ve been talking in private with people about a bunch of these things for quite a while now, and I felt it worthwhile to write down as much of my thoughts as I can before the Rust All Hands in Berlin this week.</p>

<p>In the interest of brevity<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’m going to assume the reader is roughly familiar with most of the stuff that’s happened with the Rust community in the past few years. I’m probably going to omit concrete examples of incidents, both to avoid mischaracterizing individual actions (as with most such analyses, I wish to talk in more general terms about trends), and also just because it would take me forever to write this if I were to supply all the layers of context. If you feel something is inaccurate, please let me know.</p>

<p>This blog post is probably going to reach the eyes of non-Rust-community members. You’re welcome to read it, but please accept my apologies in advance if it doesn’t make any sense. This is something that I initially planned to circulate as a private post (writing for a general audience is <em>hard</em>), but I felt this would be more widely useful. However due to time constraints I haven’t had time to edit it to make it acceptable to a wider audience.</p>

<h2 id="the-symptoms">The symptoms</h2>

<p>Before I actually get into it, I’d like to carefully delineate <em>what</em> the problem is that I’m talking about. Or more accurately, the <em>symptoms</em> I am talking about — as I’ll explain soon I feel like these are not the actual problem but symptoms of a more general problem.</p>

<p>Basically, as time has gone by our decisionmaking process has become more and more arduous, both for community members and the teams. Folks have to deal with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The same arguments getting brought up over and over again</li>
  <li>Accusations of bad faith</li>
  <li>Derailing</li>
  <li>Not feeling heard</li>
  <li>Just getting exhausted by all the stuff that’s going on</li>
</ul>

<p>The RFC process is the primary exhibitor of these symptoms, but semi-official consensus-building threads on https://internals.rust-lang.org have similar problems.</p>

<p>Aaron <a href="http://aturon.github.io/2018/05/25/listening-part-1/">has written some extremely empathetic blog posts</a> about a bunch of these problems, starting with concrete examples and ending with a takeaway of a bunch of values for us to apply as well as thoughts on what our next steps can be. I highly recommend you read them if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>Fundamentally I consider our problems to be social problems, not technical ones. In my opinion, technical solutions like changing the discussion forum format may be necessary but are not sufficient for fixing this.</p>

<h2 id="the-scaling-problem">The scaling problem</h2>

<p>I contend that all of these issues are symptoms of an underlying <em>scaling issue</em>, but also a failure of how our moderation works.</p>

<p>The scaling issue is somewhat straightforward. Such forum discussions are inherently N-to-N discussions. When you leave a comment, you’re leaving a comment for <em>everyone</em> to read and interpret, and this is hard to get right. It’s <em>much</em> easier to have one-on-one discussions because it’s easy to build a shared vocabulary and avoid misunderstandings. Any misunderstandings can often be quickly detected and corrected.</p>

<p>I find that most unpleasant technical arguments stem from an unenumerated mismatch of assumptions, or sometimes what I call a mismatch of axioms (i.e. when there is fundamental conflict between core beliefs). A mismatch of assumptions, if identified, can be resolved, leading to an amicable conclusion. Mismatches of axioms are harder to resolve, however recognizing them can take most of the vitriol out of an argument, because both parties will <em>understand</em> each other, even if they don’t <em>agree</em>. In such situations the end result may leave one or both parties <em>unhappy</em>, but rarely <em>angry</em>. (It’s also not necessary that axiom mismatches leave people unhappy, embracing <a href="http://aturon.github.io/2018/06/02/listening-part-2/#pluralism-and-positive-sums">positive sum thinking</a> helps us come to mutually beneficial conclusions)</p>

<p>All of these mismatches are easy to identify in one-on-one discussions, because it’s easy to switch gears to the meta discussion for a bit.</p>

<p>One-on-one discussions are pleasant. They foster empathy.</p>

<p>N-to-N discussions are <em>not</em>. It’s harder to converge on this shared vocabulary amongst N other people. It’s harder to identify these mismatches, partly because it’s hard to switch into the meta-mode of a discussion at all, but also because there’s a lot going on. It’s harder to build empathy.</p>

<p>As we’ve grown, discussion complexity has grown quadratically, and we’re not really attempting to relinearize them.</p>

<h3 id="hanabi-and-parallel-universes">Hanabi and parallel universes</h3>

<p>I quite enjoy the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)">Hanabi</a>. It’s a game of information and trust, and I find it extremely fun, especially with the right group.</p>

<p>Hanabi is a cooperative game. You can see everyone’s cards (or tiles) but your own, and information-sharing is severely restricted. The goal is to play the right cards in the right order to collectively win. The gimmick is to share additional information through the side-channel of <em>the choice of move you make</em>.</p>

<p>A very common occurrence in this game is that people start making plans in their mind. You typically have a decent understanding of what information everyone has, and you can use this to make predictions as to what everyone’s moves will be. With this in mind, you can attempt to “set up” situations where the game progresses rapidly in a short period of time. This is somewhat necessary for the game to work, but a common pitfall is for these plans to be <em>extremely</em> elaborate, leading to frustration as the game doesn’t actually play out as planned.</p>

<p>The core issue behind this is forgetting that you actually <em>can’t</em> see the entire game state, since your own cards are hidden. It’s not just <em>you</em> who has plans — everyone does! And each of those plans is incomplete since they’re missing a piece of the picture, just as you are.</p>

<p>In Hanabi it’s very easy to forget that you’re missing a piece of the picture — in competitive card games you mostly can’t see the game state since everyone else’s cards are hidden. But in Hanabi you can see <em>most</em> of the cards and it’s easy to forget that your own four cards are hidden from you.</p>

<p>So what ends up happening is that due to incomplete information, everyone is operating in their own little parallel universe, occasionally getting frustrated when it becomes clear that other players are not operating in the same universe. As long as you recognize the existence of these parallel universes beforehand you’re fine, but if you don’t you will be frustrated.</p>

<p>This is largely true of N-to-N discussions as well. Because most of what’s being said makes sense to an individual in a particular way, it’s very easy for them to forget that other people may not share your assumptions and thus may be on a different page. Every time someone leaves a comment, different people may interpret it differently, “forking” the common understanding of the state of the discussion into multiple parallel universes. Eventually there are enough parallel universes that everyone’s talking past each other.</p>

<p>One thing I often prefer doing in such cases is to have a one on one discussion with people who disagree with me — typically the shared understanding that is the end result of such discussions is super useful and can be brought back to the discussion as something that all participants interpret the same way. I’m not consistent in doing this — in the midst of a heated argument it’s easy to get too wrapped up in the argument to think about getting results and I’ve certainly had my time arguing instead of resolving — but overall whenever I’ve chosen to do this it’s been a useful policy.</p>

<p>This is a good example of how relinearization and communication can help move N-to-N discussions along. Operating in different parallel universes is kind of the <em>point</em> of Hanabi, but it’s not the point of having a technical discussion.</p>

<h2 id="the-moderation-problem">The moderation problem</h2>

<p>In a technical discussion, broadly speaking, I find that there are three kinds of comments disagreeing with you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Constructive: Comments which disagree with you constructively. We’re glad these exist, disagreement can hurt but is necessary for us to collaboratively reach the best outcomes.</li>
  <li>Disruptive: Comments which may be written in good faith but end up being disruptive. For example, this includes people who don’t read enough of the discussion and end up rehashing the same points. It also includes taking discussions off topic. These kinds of things are problematic but not covered by the code of conduct.</li>
  <li>Abrasive: Comments which are rude/abrasive. These are covered by the code of conduct. The mod team tries to handle these.</li>
</ul>

<p>(For a long time I and <a href="http://twitter.com/aaron_turon/">Aaron</a> had a shared vocabulary of “Type A, B, C” for these, mostly because I’m often unimaginative when it comes to such things, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mark-simulacrum">Mark</a> for coming up with, better, descriptive titles)</p>

<p>Note that while I’m talking about “disruptive” comments it’s not a judgement on the <em>intent</em> of the participants, but rather a judgement on the harm it has caused.</p>

<p>The second category – disruptive comments – are the thing we’re currently unable to handle well. They snowball pretty badly too — as more and more of these collect, more and more people get frustrated and in turn leave comments that cause further disruption. As the discussion progresses into more and more “parallel universes” it also just becomes <em>easier</em> for a comment to be disruptive.</p>

<p>The Rust moderation team operates mostly passively, we simply don’t have the scale<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> to watch for and nip these things in the bud. Active moderation requires a degree of involvement we cannot provide. So while the best response would be to work with participants and resolve issues early as we see them crop up, we typically get pulled in at a point where some participants are already causing harm, and our response has to be more severe. It’s a bit of a catch-22: it’s not exactly our job to deal with this stuff<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, but by the time it <em>becomes</em> our job (or even, by the time we <em>notice</em>), most acceptable actions for us to take are extremely suboptimal. The problem with passive moderation is that it’s largely reactive — it’s harder to proactively nudge the discussion in the right direction when you don’t even <em>notice</em> what’s going on until it’s too late. This is largely okay for dealing with bad-faith actors (the main goal of the mod team); it’s hard to <em>prevent</em> someone from deciding to harass someone else. But for dealing with disruptive buildups, we kind of need something different.</p>

<h2 id="participation-guidelines">Participation guidelines</h2>

<p>Part of the solution here is recognizing that spaces for official discussion are <em>different</em> from community hangout spaces. Our code of conduct attempts to handle abrasive behavior, which can disrupt discussions anywhere, but the comments that can disrupt consensusbuilding official discussions aren’t really covered. Nor are the repercussions of code of conduct violations really <em>appropriate</em> for such disruptive comments anyway.</p>

<p>A proposal I’ve circulated in the past is to have a notion of participation guidelines. Discussions in team spaces (RFCs, pre-RFCs, discord/zulip/IRC channels during team meetings) follow a set of rules set forth by the individual teams. It might be worth having a base set of participation guidelines defined by the core team. Something like the following is a very rough strawman:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t have irrelevant discussions during team meetings on Discord/IRC/Zulip</li>
  <li>Don’t take threads off topic</li>
  <li>Don’t rehash discussions</li>
</ul>

<p>We ask people to read these before participating, but also breaking these rules isn’t considered serious, it just triggers a conversation (and maybe the hiding/deletion of a comment). If someone repeatedly breaks these rules they may be asked to not participate in a given thread anymore. The primary goal here is to empower team members to better deal with disruptive comments by giving them a formalized framework. Having codified rules helps team members confidently deal with such situations without having to worry as much about drawing direct ire from affected community members.</p>

<p>A base participation guidelines document can also be a value statement, not just a set of rules but also set of values. These values can be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“We explicitly value high empathy interactions”</li>
  <li>“How everyone is feeling is everyone’s business”</li>
</ul>

<p>(h/t <a href="http://twitter.com/adam_n_p/">Adam</a> for the articulate wording here)</p>

<p>Having such words written somewhere — both the high level values we expect people to hold, and the individual behaviors we expect people to exhibit (or not exhibit) — is really valuable in and of itself, even if not enforced. The value of such documents is not that everyone reads them before participating — most don’t — but they serve as a good starting point for people interested in learning how to best conduct themselves, as well as an easy place to point people to where they’re having trouble doing so.</p>

<p>On its own, I find that this is a powerful framework but may not achieve the goal of improving the situation. I recently realized that this actually couples really well with a <em>different</em> idea I’ve been talking about for quite a while now, the idea of having facilitators:</p>

<h2 id="facilitators">Facilitators</h2>

<p>A common conflict I see occurring is that in many cases it’s a team’s job to think about and opine on a technical decision, but it’s also the team’s job to shepherd the discussion for that decision. This often works out great, but it also leads to people just feeling unheard. It kinda hurts when someone who has just strongly disagreed with you goes on to summarize the state of the discussion in a way that you feel you’ve been unfairly represented. The natural response to that for most people isn’t to work with that person and try to be properly represented, it’s to just get angry, leading to less empathy over time.</p>

<p>By design, Rust team members are <em>partisan</em>. The teams exist to build well-informed, carefully crafted opinions, and present them to the community. They also exist to make final decisions based on the results of a consensusbuilding discussion, which can involve picking sides. This is fine, there is always going to be some degree of partisanship amongst decisionmakers, or decisions would not get made.</p>

<p>Having team members also facilitate discussions is somewhat at odds with all of this. Furthermore, I feel like they don’t have enough bandwidth to do this well anyway. Some teams do have a concept of “sheriffs”, but this is more of an onramp to full team membership and the role of a sheriff is largely the same as the role of a team member, just without a binding vote.</p>

<p>I feel like it would be useful to have a group of (per-team?) <em>facilitators</em> to help with this. Facilitators are people who are interested in seeing progress happening, and largely don’t have <em>much</em> of an opinion on a given discussion, or are able to set aside this opinion in the interest of moving a discussion forward. They operate largely at the meta level of the discussion. Actions they may take are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Summarizing the discussion every now and then</li>
  <li>Calling out one sided discussions</li>
  <li>Encouraging one-on-one tangents to be discussed elsewhere (perhaps creating a space for them, like an issue)</li>
  <li>Calling out specific people to do a thing that helps move the discussion forward. For example, something like “hey @Manishearth, I noticed you’ve been vocal in <a href="https://github.com/mystor/slag">arguing that Rust should switch to whitespace-sensitive syntax</a>, could you summarize all the arguments made by people on your side?” would help.</li>
  <li>Reinforcing positive behavior</li>
  <li>Occasionally pinging participants privately to help them improve their comments</li>
  <li>Attempting to identify the root cause of a disagreement, or empowering people to work together to identify this. This one is important but tricky. I’ve often enjoyed doing it — noticing the core axiomatic disagreement at play and spelling it out is a great feeling. But I’ve also found that it’s incredibly hard to do when you’re emotionally involved, and I’ve often needed a nudge from someone else to get there.</li>
</ul>

<p>At a high level, the job of the facilitators is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help foster empathy between participants</li>
  <li>help linearize complex discussions</li>
  <li>nudge towards cooperative behavior, away from adversarial behavior. Get people playing not to win, but to win-win.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to note that facilitators don’t make decisions — the team does. In fact, they almost completely avoid making technical points, they instead keep their comments largely at the meta level, perhaps occasionally making factual corrections.</p>

<p>The teams <em>could</em> do most of this themselves<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, but as I’ve mentioned before it’s harder for others to not perceive all of your actions as partisan when some of them are. Furthermore, it can come off as patronizing at times.</p>

<p>This is also something the moderation team could do, however it’s <em>much</em> harder to scale the moderation team this way. Given that the moderation team deals with harassment and stuff like that, we need to be careful about how we build it up. On the other hand facilitating discussions is largely a public task, and the stakes aren’t as high: screwups can get noticed, and they don’t cause much harm. As a fundamentally <em>proactive</em> moderation effort, most actions taken will be to nudge things in a positive direction; getting this wrong usually just means that the status quo is maintained, not that harm is caused. Also, from talking to people it seems that while very few people want to be involved in moderating Rust, this notion of <em>facilitating</em> sounds much more fun and rewarding (I’d love to hear from people who would like to help).</p>

<p>And to me, this pairs really well with the idea of participation guidelines: teams can write down how they want discussions to take place on their venues, and facilitators can help ensure this works out. It’s good to look at the participation guidelines less as a set of rules and more as an aspiration for how we conduct ourselves, with the facilitators as a means to achieving that goal.</p>

<p>There are a lot of specifics we can twiddle with this proposal. For example, we can have a per-team group of appointed facilitators (with no overlap with the team), and for a given discussion one facilitator is picked (if they don’t have time or feel like they have strong opinions, try someone else). But there’s also no strong need for there to be such a group, facilitators can be picked as a discussion is starting, too. I don’t expect <em>most</em> discussions to need facilitators, so this is mostly reserved for discussions we expect will get heated, or discussions that have started to get heated. I’m not really going to spend time analysing these specifics; I have opinions but I’d rather have us figure out if we want to do something like this and how before getting into the weeds.</p>

<h2 id="prospective-outcomes">Prospective outcomes</h2>

<p>The real goal here is to bootstrap better empathy within the community. In an ideal world we don’t need facilitators, instead everyone is able to facilitate well. The explicitly non-partisan nature of facilitators is <em>useful</em>, but if everyone was able to operate in this manner it would largely be unnecessary. But as with any organization, being able to horizontally scale specific skills is really tricky without specialization.</p>

<p>I suspect that in the process of building up such a team of facilitators, we will also end up building a set of resources that can help others learn to act the same way, and eventually overall improve how empathetic our community is.</p>

<p>The concept of facilitators directly addresses the moderation problem, but it also handles the scaling problem pretty well! Facilitators are key in re-linearizing the n-to-n discussions, bringing the “parallel universes” together again. This should overall help people (especially team members) who are feeling overwhelmed by all the things that are going on.</p>

<p>This also helps with concerns people have that they’re not getting heard, as facilitators are basically posed as allies on all sides of the argument; people whose primary goal is to <em>help communication happen</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall what I’ve proposed here isn’t a fully-formed idea; but it’s the seed of one. There are a lot of interesting bits to discuss and build upon. I’m hoping through this post we might push forward some of the discussions about governance — both by providing a strawman idea, as well as by providing a perspective on the problem that I hope is useful.</p>

<p>I’m really interested to hear what people think!</p>
