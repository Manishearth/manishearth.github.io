    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whose words are these I think I know<br />
His house is in the village though<br />
He will not see me stopping here<br />
To interpret his work as I go<br /></p>

<p>My little student must think it queer<br />
To read without some context near<br />
Between the words and the intent<br />
He wonders what the poem meant<br /></p>

<p>He gives his head a little shake<br />
To ask if there is some mistake<br />
“That’s not what the author said!”<br />
Providing another view instead<br /></p>

<p>The words are lovely, dark, and deep<br />
But I have literary criticism to preach<br />
And miles to go before I sleep<br />
And miles to go before I sleep<br /></p>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Seriously though, try reading <em>The Road Not Taken</em> as metacircular commentary on how the poem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#Analysis">is very often “mis”interpreted</a>, and the nature of interpretation / <em>Death of the Author</em>. It fits perfectly when
you read “road” as “interpretation”.</p>

<p><small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to send a missive today<br />
As I have done so oft before<br />
But I forgot to employ that scrap of advice<br />
“Use Signal. Use Tor.”</p>

<p>Intercepted of course the missive was<br />
By a ferocious beast of lore<br />
Because I failed to use that bit of advice<br />
“Use Signal. Use Tor.”</p>

<p>The beast was strong; and formidable<br />
He hated the amendments four<br />
I should have remembered that piece of advice<br />
“Use Signal. Use Tor.”</p>

<p>I tried to reason with the beast<br />
but he only wanted war<br />
Do not neglect that important advice<br />
“Use Signal. Use Tor.”</p>

<p>Here I lie in the belly of the beast<br />
I shall discount this advice no more<br />
If I ever manage to leave this place<br />
I’ll use Signal, and Tor.</p>

<p>Heed this advice, children.<br />
It’s not something to ignore<br />
Always, always, always, always<br />
Use Signal. Use Tor.</p>
