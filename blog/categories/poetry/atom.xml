    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whose words are these I think I know<br>
His house is in the village though<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To interpret his work as I go<br></p>

<p>My little student must think it queer<br>
To read without some context near<br>
Between the words and the intent<br>
He wonders what the poem meant<br></p>

<p>He gives his head a little shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what the author said!&rdquo;<br>
Providing another view instead<br></p>

<p>The words are lovely, dark, and deep<br>
But I have literary criticism to preach<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br></p>

<hr />

<p><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Seriously though, try reading <em>The Road Not Taken</em> as metacircular commentary on how the poem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#Analysis">is very often &ldquo;mis&#8221;interpreted</a>, and the nature of interpretation / <em>Death of the Author</em>. It fits perfectly when
you read &ldquo;road&rdquo; as &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;.</p>

<p><small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to send a missive today<br>
As I have done so oft before<br>
But I forgot to employ that scrap of advice<br>
&ldquo;Use Signal. Use Tor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Intercepted of course the missive was<br>
By a ferocious beast of lore<br>
Because I failed to use that bit of advice<br>
&ldquo;Use Signal. Use Tor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beast was strong; and formidable<br>
He hated the amendments four<br>
I should have remembered that piece of advice<br>
&ldquo;Use Signal. Use Tor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to reason with the beast<br>
but he only wanted war<br>
Do not neglect that important advice<br>
&ldquo;Use Signal. Use Tor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here I lie in the belly of the beast<br>
I shall discount this advice no more<br>
If I ever manage to leave this place<br>
I&rsquo;ll use Signal, and Tor.</p>

<p>Heed this advice, children.<br>
It&rsquo;s not something to ignore<br>
Always, always, always, always<br>
Use Signal. Use Tor.</p>
