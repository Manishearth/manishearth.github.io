    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve added a couple new styling elements to my blog and I make use of them extensively in upcoming posts, I thought I’d talk a bit about them because I expect people will have questions.</p>

<p>The main thing is that I have nice aside styling.</p>

<div class="post-aside post-aside-example">Asides are things that look like <em>this</em>.</div>

<p>The actual color scheme comes from the asides used in <a href="https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/">bikeshed</a>, the tool used to generate Web specifications and C++ spec proposals. I edit a couple <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">WebXR</a> specs and used to read specs very often when I worked on browsers; I like the styling they use.</p>

<div class="post-aside post-aside-note">I also think it’s kinda funny to get readers do a double-take when they see familiar styling out of context.</div>

<p>Besides the “example” and “note” ones shown above, there’s also an “issue” one.</p>

<div class="post-aside post-aside-issue">Figure out a way to include an example of an “issue” aside in this post that works in context like the “note” and “example” ones.</div>

<p>These asides are useful for calling out supplemental information; and add to my existing repertoire of footnotes, em dashes, semicolons, and parentheses as a nonlinear writing tool.</p>

<div class="discussion discussion-issue">
            <img class="bobblehead" width="60px" height="60px" title="Negative pion" alt="Speech bubble for character Negative pion" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/pion-minus.png" />
            <div class="discussion-spacer"></div>
            <div class="discussion-text">
             Manish, you’re burying the lede.
            </div>
        </div>

<p>Oh, right. Fine. The pions.</p>

<p>I’ve also introduced three similarly styled “character discussion” asides that show a discussion with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion">pion</a>. There’s a “positive” one that’s generally helpful, a “negative” one that’s grumpy, and a “confused” (neutrally charged) one that asks questions.</p>

<p>Having little characters participate in the blog post works really well; it gives a sense of <em>flow</em> to the articles. I’m also hoping it makes them easier to read, breaking up otherwise dense technical content with lighter conversational content<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Asking questions through them give the reader an anchor point for themselves if they’re similarly confused, without me making any assumption that the reader did or didn’t understand a part.</p>

<p>They’re also <em>yet another</em> way for me to write nonlinearly, and I <em>love</em> writing nonlinearly.</p>

<p>Adding interlocutors to my blog was extremely inspired by other people: <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles">Amos</a> has Cool Bear, and <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/">Xe</a> has <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/how-mara-works-2020-09-30">Mara</a>, both of which serve similar purposes. While <a href="https://myrrlyn.net/blog">Alex</a> doesn’t quite have interlocutors, their use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_7010">ISO 7010</a> icons for asides gave me the idea to use something relevant to my interests while picking characters.</p>

<div class="discussion discussion-example">
            <img class="bobblehead" width="60px" height="60px" title="Confused pion" alt="Speech bubble for character Confused pion" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/pion-nought.png" />
            <div class="discussion-spacer"></div>
            <div class="discussion-text">
             Okay but why pions? Scratch that, <em>what</em> is a pion?
            </div>
        </div>

<p>You’re a pion!</p>

<div class="discussion discussion-example">
            <img class="bobblehead" width="60px" height="60px" title="Confused pion" alt="Speech bubble for character Confused pion" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/pion-nought.png" />
            <div class="discussion-spacer"></div>
            <div class="discussion-text">
             You know what I meant!
            </div>
        </div>

<p>Okay, okay.</p>

<p>So a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion">pion</a> is a type of subatomic particle, and is part of the mechanism holding the nucleus of an atom together. There are three of them, π<sup>0</sup> , π<sup>+</sup> , and π<sup>−</sup>, with the positive and negative ones being antiparticles of each other.</p>

<p>As for <em>why</em> I’ve chosen that particle in particular, explaining that requires some history first.</p>

<p>Back when we only knew about protons, neutrons, and electrons, physicists were attempting to figure out how atomic nuclei stay together. They’re made of protons and neutrons, which means they’re just a lot of positively and neutrally changed thingies crammed into a tight space. There’s not much reason for that to want to stay together, but there’s plenty of reason for it to come apart. This is rather concerning to beings made out of atoms, like physicists.</p>

<p>To resolve this, physicists theorized the existence of the pion<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, a type of particle that is exchanged between protons and neutrons in the nucleus and forms a mechanism for carrying force.</p>

<div class="discussion discussion-note">
            <img class="bobblehead" width="60px" height="60px" title="Positive pion" alt="Speech bubble for character Positive pion" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/pion-plus.png" />
            <div class="discussion-spacer"></div>
            <div class="discussion-text">
             <p><em>Why</em> “exchanging particles” works to carry force is a complicated topic (and “exchanging particles” is a very simplistic characterization) that would be very hard to explain here, but you can read up on “force carriers” in quantum field theory if you’re interested.</p>

<p>A useful example is that photons are force carriers for the electromagnetic force, which is why you can make radio waves (made up of photons) by messing with electromagnetic fields.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

<p>And when physicists think there’s a new particle, of course they go looking for it. And they did!</p>

<p>… but they found something else entirely.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, this was not the heyday of particle discovery when there was a new particle being discovered every Tuesday. Physicists knew about protons, neutrons, electrons, and probably pions, and were justifiably surprised when a completely different particle came knocking. Instead of having the properties they expected for the pion, it was basically like a heavier electron.</p>

<p>The physicist I. I. Rabi famously remarked “Who ordered that?” when they figured out what had happened. There was no <em>reason</em> for such a particle to exist, they had this nice consistent model of the atom that needed four kinds of particle and they found this fifth one just floating around, not really <em>doing</em> anything.</p>

<p>This particle was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon">muon</a>, and this story is why I use a Greek μ as my avatar everywhere<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Given this history, the pion feels like a very natural choice as a foil in blog posts I write.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are three of them, which lets me use them for different purposes! One for “positive” commentary, one for “negative” commentary, and a third “confused” one for questions.</p>

<div class="discussion discussion-note">
            <img class="bobblehead" width="60px" height="60px" title="Positive pion" alt="Speech bubble for character Positive pion" src="http://manishearth.github.io/images/pion-plus.png" />
            <div class="discussion-spacer"></div>
            <div class="discussion-text">
             The neutral pion being “confused” actually works really well because while π<sup>+</sup> (and π<sup>−</sup>) have straightforward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark">quark</a> representations of an up and antidown quark (and a down and an antiup quark for π<sup>−</sup>), π<sup>0</sup> is a superposition between either an up and antiup quark or a down and antidown quark.
            </div>
        </div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I can’t wait for people to get to see more of these in my upcoming posts; I really enjoyed writing with them!</p>

    <link href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/08/26/why-i-enjoy-blogging/"/>
    <updated>2018-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/08/26/why-i-enjoy-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>See also: <a href="https://myrrlyn.net/blog/misc/to-all-the-posts-ive-blogged-before">Alex’s version of this blog post</a></em></p>

<p>I started this blog three years ago, moving from my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.com/">older blog</a>, hoping to written about programming, math, physics, books, and miscellenia. I’ve not quite written about everything I wanted to, but I’ve been very very happy with the experience of blogging. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> says I’ve written almost 75k words, which is mind-boggling to me!</p>

<p>I often get asked by others — usually trying to decide if they should start blogging — what it’s like. I also often try to convince friends to blog by enumerating why I think it’s awesome. Might as well write it down so that it’s generally useful for everyone! 😃</p>

<h2 id="blogging-helps-cement-my-understanding-of-things">Blogging helps cement my understanding of things!</h2>

<p>I’ve often noticed that I’ll start blogging about something I <em>think</em> I understand, and it turns out that my understanding of the subject was somewhat nebulous. Turns out it’s pretty easy to convince ourselves that we understand something.</p>

<p>The act of writing stuff down helps cement my own understanding — words are usually not as nebulous as thoughts so I’m forced to figure out little details.</p>

<p>I recall when I wrote my post on <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/30/how-rust-achieves-thread-safety/">how Rust’s thread safety guarantees work</a>, I <em>thought</em> I understood <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sync</code> in Rust. I understood what they did, but I didn’t have a clear mental model for them. I obtained this mental model through the process of writing the post; to be able to explain it to others I had to first explain it to myself.</p>

<p>I point out this post in particular because this was both one of the first posts for me where I’d noticed this, and, more importantly, my more concrete mental model led to me <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25894">finding a soundness bug in Rust’s standard library</a>. When I was thinking about my mental model I realized “an impl that looks like this should never exist”,
so I grepped the source code and found one<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I’ve even noticed a difference between one-on-one explaining and explaining things through blog posts. I <em>love</em> explaining things one-on-one, it’s much easier to tailor the explanation to the other person’s background,
as well as what they’re actually asking for help with. Plus, it’s interactive. A <em>lot</em> of my posts are of the “okay I get this question a lot I’m going to write down the answer so I don’t have to repeat myself” kind and I’ve found that I’ve often learned things from these despite having talked about the thing in the article contents multiple times.</p>

<p>I guess it’s basically that blogging is inherently one-many — you’re trying to explain to a whole group of people with varied backgrounds — which means you need to cover all your bases<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and explain everything together instead of the minimum necessary.</p>

<h2 id="its-really-fun-to-revisit-old-posts">It’s really fun to revisit old posts!</h2>

<p>Okay, I’ll admit that I never really write blog posts with this in mind. But when I <em>do</em> reread them, I’m usually quite thankful I wrote them!</p>

<p>I’m a fan of rereading in general, I’ve reread most of my favorite books tens of times; I make a yearly pilgrimage to <a href="https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens">James Mickens’ website</a>; I reread many of my favorite posts and articles on the internet; and I often reread my <em>own</em> posts from the past.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’ll do it because I want a refresher in a topic. Sometimes I’ll do it because I’m bored. Whatever the reason, it’s always been a useful and fun thing to do.</p>

<p>Rereading old posts is a great way to transport myself back to my mindset from when I wrote the post. It’s easy to see progress in my understanding of things as well as in my writing. It’s interesting to note what I thought super important to include in the post <em>then</em> that I consider totally obvious <em>now</em><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It’s interesting to relearn what I’ve forgotten. It’s reassuring to realize that my terrible jokes were just as terrible as they are now.</p>

<p>One of my favorite posts to reread is <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/exploring-zero-knowledge-proofs/">this really long one on generalized zero knowledge proofs</a>. It’s the longest post I’ve written so far<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and it’s on a topic I don’t deal with often — cryptography. Not only does it help put me back in a mindset for thinking about cryptography, it’s about something super interesting but also complicated enough that rereading the post is like learning it all over again.</p>

<h2 id="it-lets-me-exercise-a-different-headspace">It lets me exercise a different headspace!</h2>

<p>I like programming a lot, but if programming was <em>all</em> I did, I’d get tired pretty quickly. When I was a student learning physics I’d often contribute to open source in my spare time, but now I write code full time so I’m less inclined to do it in my free time<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But I still sometimes feel like doing programmery things in my spare time just … not programming.</p>

<p>Turns out that blogging doesn’t tire me out the same way! I’m sure that if I spent the whole day writing I’d not want to write when I go home, but I don’t spend the whole day writing, so it’s all good. It’s refreshing to sit down to write a blog post and discover a fresh reserve of energy. I’m not sure if this is the right term, but I usually call this “using a different headspace”.</p>

<p>I’ve also started using this to plan my work, I mix up the kinds of headspace I’m employing for various tasks so that I feel energetic throughout the day.</p>

<p>This is also why I really enjoy mentoring — mentoring often requires the same effort from me as fixing it myself, but it’s a different headspace I’m employing so it’s less tiring.</p>

<h2 id="blogging-lets-me-be-lazy">Blogging lets me be lazy!</h2>

<p>I often find myself explaining things often. I like helping folks and explaining things, but I’m also lazy<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, so writing stuff down really makes stuff easy for me! If folks ask me a question I can give a quick answer and then go “if you want to learn more, I’ve written about it here!”. If folks are asking a question a lot, there’s probably something missing in the documentation or learning materials about it. Some things can be fixed upstream in documentation, but other things — like <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/05/14/mentally-modelling-modules/">“how should I reason about modules in Rust?”</a> deserve to be tackled as a separate problem and addressed with their own post.</p>

<p>(Yes, this post is in this category!)</p>

<h2 id="its-okay-if-folks-have-written-about-it-before">It’s okay if folks have written about it before!</h2>

<p>A common question I’ve gotten is “Well I can write about X but … there are a lot of other posts out there about it, should I still?”</p>

<p>Yes!!</p>

<p>People think differently, people learn differently, and people come from different backgrounds. Existing posts may be useful for some folks but less useful for others.</p>

<p>My personal rule of thumb is that if it took <em>me</em> some effort to understand something after reading about it, that’s something worth writing about, so it’s easier to understand for others like me encountering the subject.</p>

<p>One of my favorite bloggers, <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> very often writes posts explaining computer concepts. Most of the times these have been explained before in other blog posts or manuals. But that doesn’t matter — her posts are <em>different</em>, and they’re <em>amazing</em>. They’re upbeat, fun to read, and often get me excited to learn more about things I knew about but never really looked at closely before.</p>

<h2 id="i-kinda-feel-its-my-duty-to">I kinda feel it’s my duty to?</h2>

<p>There’s a quote by Toni Morrison I quite enjoy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tell my students, ‘When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I enjoy it so much I <a href="https://manishearth.github.io/rustfest-slides/#/13">concluded my talk at RustFest Kyiv with it</a>!</p>

<p>I have the privilege of having time to do things like blogging and mentoring. Given that, I feel that it really is my duty to share what I know as much as possible; to help others attempting to tread the path I’m treading; and to battle against tribal knowledge.</p>

<p>When it comes to programming I’m mostly “self-taught”. But when I say that, I really mean that I wasn’t taught in a traditional way by other humans — I learned things by trying stuff out and <em>reading what others had written</em>. I didn’t learn Rust by taking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rustc</code> and pretending to be a fuzzer and just trying random nonsense till stuff made sense, I went through the tutorial (and <em>then</em> started exploring by trying random stuff). I didn’t figure out cool algorithms by discovering them from first principles, I picked them up from books and blog posts. I’m “self-taught” because I’ve been in charge of my learning process, but I’ve definitely relied on the work of other people throughout this process.</p>

<p>This means that for me, personally, knowledge-sharing is especially important. If I had to spend time figuring something out, I should make it easier for the next people to try<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>(All this said, I probably don’t blog as much as I <em>should</em>)</p>

<h2 id="you-should-blog-too">You should blog too!</h2>

<p>I wish everyone wrote more. I know not everyone has the time/privilege to do this, but if you do, I urge you to start!</p>

<p>I feel like tips on <em>how</em> to blog would fill up an entire other blog post, but Julia Evans has <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts//">multiple</a> <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/20/blogging-principles/">posts</a> on this that I strongly recommend. Feel free to ask me for review on posts!</p>

<p>As for the technicalities of setting up a blog, my colleague Emily recently <a href="https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2018/07/27/myo-website.html">wrote a great post about doing this with Jekyll</a>. This blog uses <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> which is similar to set up.</p>
