<div class="entry-content"><p>For a while I’ve been working on a <a href="http://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">garbage collector for Rust</a> with <a href="http://github.com/mystor">Nika
Layzell</a>. I thought this would be a good time to talk of our design and progress so far.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>“Wait”, you ask, “why does Rust need a garbage collector”? Rust is supposed to work <em>without</em> a GC,
that’s one of its main selling points!</p>

<p>True. Rust <em>does</em> work pretty well without a GC. It’s managed to do without one so far, and we still
have all sorts of well-written crates out there (none of which use a GC).</p>

<p>But Rust is not just about low-cost memory safety. It’s also <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/">about choosing your costs and
guarantees</a>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and stack allocation are not always sufficient, sometimes one needs to
reach for something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> (reference counting). But even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> is not perfect; it can’t handle
cycles between pointers. There are solutions to that issue like using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>, but that only works
in limited cases (when you know what the points-to graph looks like at compile time), and isn’t very
ergonomic.</p>

<p>Cases where one needs to maintain a complicated, dynamic graph are where a GC becomes useful.
Similarly, if one is writing an interpreter for a GCd language, having a GC in Rust would simplify
things a lot.</p>

<p>Not to say that one should pervasively use a GC in Rust. Similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, it’s best to use
regular ownership-based memory management as much as possible, and sprinkle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc</code> in places
where your code needs it.</p>

<h1 id="previous-designs">Previous designs</h1>

<p>This isn’t the first GC in Rust. Automatic memory management has existed before in various forms,
but all were limited.</p>

<p>Besides the ones listed below, Nick Fitzgerald’s <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/bacon-rajan-cc">cycle collector</a> based on <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon01Concurrent.pdf">this paper</a>
exists and is something that you should look into if you’re interested. There’s also <a href="https://github.com/pliniker/mo-gc/blob/master/doc/Project-RFC.md">an RFC</a>
by Peter Liniker which sketches out a design for an immutable GC.</p>

<h2 id="core-rust-gcs">Core Rust GC(s)</h2>

<p>Rust itself had a garbage collector until a bit more than a year ago. These “managed pointers”
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@T</code>) were part of the language. They were removed later with a plan to make GC a library feature.</p>

<p>I believe these were basically reference counted (cycle collected?) pointers with some language
integration, but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the only form of automatic memory management in Rust are via <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arc</code></a>
which are nonatomic and atomic reference counted pointers respectively. In other words, they keep
track of the number of shared references via a reference count (incremented when it is cloned,
decremented when destructors run). If the reference count reaches zero, the contents are cleaned up.</p>

<p>This is a pretty useful abstraction, however, as mentioned above, it doesn’t let you create cycles
without leaking them.</p>

<h2 id="spidermonkey">Spidermonkey</h2>

<p><em>You can read more about Servo’s Spidermonkey bindings <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/08/26/javascript-servos-only-garbage-collector/">in this blog post</a> (somewhat
outdated, but still relevant)</em></p>

<p>In Servo we use <a href="http://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs/">bindings to the Spidermonkey Javascript engine</a>. Since Javascript is a
garbage collected language, the Rust representations of Javascript objects are also garbage
collected.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of GC isn’t really useful for generic use since it comes bundled with a JS
runtime. However, the Rust side of the GC is of a design that could be used in an independent
library.</p>

<p>The Rust side of the Spidermonkey GC is done through a bunch of smart pointers, and a trait called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSTraceable</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSTraceable</code> is a trait which can “trace” recursively down some data, finding and
marking all GC-managed objects inside it. This is autoderived using Rust’s plugin infrastructure, so
a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[jstraceable]</code> annotation will generate trace hooks for the struct it is on.</p>

<p>Now, we have various smart pointers. The first is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is opaque, but can be held by other
GC-managed structs. To use this on the stack, this must be explicitly <em>rooted</em>, via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.root()</code>. This
produces a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root&lt;T&gt;</code>, which can be dereferenced to get the inner object. When the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root</code> is created,
the contained object is listed in a collection of “roots” in a global. A root indicates that the
value is being used on the stack somewhere, and the GC starts tracing usage from these roots. When
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Root&lt;T&gt;</code> is destroyed, the root is removed.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> doesn’t work on the stack. There is no way for the GC to know
that we are holding on to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> on the stack. So, if I copy a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> to the stack, remove all
references to it from objects in the GC heap, and trigger a collection, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> will still be
around on the stack after collection since the GC can’t trace to it. If I attempt to root it, I may
get a panic or a segfault depending on the implementation.</p>

<p>To protect against this, we have a bunch of lints. The <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/plugins/lints/unrooted_must_root.rs">relevant one</a> here protects
against <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JS&lt;T&gt;</code> from being carried around on the stack; but like most lints, it’s not perfect.</p>

<p>To summarize: Spidermonkey gives us a good GC. However using it for a generic Rust program is ill
advised. Additionally, Servo’s wrappers around the GC are cheap, but need lints for safety. While it
would probably be possible to write safer wrappers for general usage, it’s pretty impractical to
carry around a JS runtime when you don’t need one.</p>

<p>However, Spidermonkey’s GC did inspire me to think more into the matter.</p>

<h1 id="brainstorming-a-design">Brainstorming a design</h1>

<p>For quite a while I’d had various ideas about GCs. Most were simplifications of Servo’s wrappers
(there’s some complexity brought in there by Spidermonkey that’s not necessary for a general GC).
Most were tracing/rooting with mark-and-sweep collection. All of them used lints. Being rather busy,
I didn’t really work on it past that, but planned to work on it if I could find someone to work
with.</p>

<p>One day, <a href="http://github.com/mystor">Nika</a> pinged me on IRC and asked me about GCs. Lots of people knew that I was
interested in writing a GC for Rust, and one of them directed her to me when she expressed a similar
interest.</p>

<p>So we started discussing GCs. We settled on a tracing mark-and-sweep GC. In other words, the GC runs
regular “sweeps” where it first “traces” the usage of all objects and marks them and their children
as used, and then sweeps up all unused objects.</p>

<p>This model on its own has a flaw. It doesn’t know about GC pointers held on the stack as local
variables (“stack roots”). There are multiple methods for solving this. We’ve already seen one above
in the Spidermonkey design – maintain two types of pointers (one for the stack, one for the heap),
and try very hard using static analysis to ensure that they don’t cross over.</p>

<p>A common model (used by GCs like Boehm, called “conservative GCs”) is to do something called “stack
scanning”. In such a system, the GC goes down the stack looking for things which may perhaps be GC
pointers. Generally the GC allocates objects in known regions of the memory, so a GC pointer is any
value on the stack which belongs to one of these regions.</p>

<p>Of course, this makes garbage collection rather inefficient, and will miss cases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;Gc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>
where the GCd pointer is accessible, but through a non-GC pointer.</p>

<p>We decided rather early on that we didn’t want a GC based on lints or stack scanning. Both are
rather suboptimal solutions in my opinion, and very hard to make sound<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. We were also hoping that
Rust’s type system and ownership semantics could help us in designing a good, safe, API.</p>

<p>So, we needed a way to keep track of roots, and we needed a way to trace objects.</p>

<h2 id="tracing">Tracing</h2>

<p>The latter part was easy. We wrote a compiler plugin (well, we stole <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/plugins/jstraceable.rs#L38">Servo’s tracing plugin which
I’d written earlier</a>) which autoderives an implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait on any
given struct or enum, using the same internal infrastructure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[derive(PartialEq)]</code> and the
rest use. So, with just the following code, it’s easy to make a struct or enum gc-friendly:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Bar</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Baz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">u8</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">Quux</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.trace()</code>, will expand to a call of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.x.trace()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.y.trace()</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar.trace()</code> will check which variant it is and call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u8</code> inside
if it’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Baz</code>. For most structs this turns out to be a no-op and is often optimized away by
inlining, but if a struct contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the special implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> will
“mark” the traceability of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>. Types without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> implemented cannot be used in types
implementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> or in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc</code>, which is enforced with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T: Trace</code> bound on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So, we have a way of walking the fields of a given object and finding inner <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s. Splendid. This
lets us write the mark&amp;sweep phase easily: Take the list of known reachable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s, walk their
contents until you find more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s (marking all you find), and clean up any which aren’t
reachable.</p>

<h2 id="rooting">Rooting</h2>

<p>Of course, now we have to solve the problem of keeping track of the known reachable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s, i.e.
the roots. This is a hard problem to solve without language support, and I hope that eventually we
might be able to get the language hooks necessary to solve it. LLVM <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GarbageCollection.html#gcroot">has support for tracking
GCthings on the stack</a>, and some day we may be able to leverage that in Rust.</p>

<p>As noted above, Spidermonkey’s solution was to have non-rooted (non-dereferencable) heap pointers,
which can be explicitly converted to rooted pointers and then read.</p>

<p>We went the other way. All <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> pointers, when created, are considered “rooted”. The instance of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> has a “rooted” bit set to true, and the underlying shared box (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcBox</code>, though this is not a
public interface) has its “root count” set to one.</p>

<p>When this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> is cloned, an identical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> (with rooted bit set to true) is returned, and the
underlying root count is incremented. Cloning a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc</code> does not perform a deep copy.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// a.root = true, (*a.ptr).roots = 1, (*a.ptr).data = 20</span>

<span class="c1">// ptr points to the underlying box, which contains the data as well as</span>
<span class="c1">// GC metadata like the root count. `Gc::new()` will allocate this box</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="nf">.clone</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// b.root = true, (*a.ptr).roots++, b.ptr = a.ptr</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is rather similar to how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc</code> works, however there is no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> field, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roots</code> counter
is called a “reference counter”.</p>

<p>For regular local sharing, it is recommended to just use a borrowed reference to the inner variable
(borrowing works fine with rust-gc!) since there is no cost to creating this reference.</p>

<p>When a GC thing is put inside another GC thing, the first thing no longer can remain a root. This is
handled by “unrooting” the first GC thing:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u32</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">baz</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">u32</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// why anyone would want to GC an integer I'll never know</span>
                     <span class="c1">// but I'll stick with this example since it's simple</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">baz</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">});</span>
<span class="c1">// a.root = false, (*a.ptr).roots--</span>
<span class="c1">// b initialized similar to previous example</span>

<span class="c1">// `a` was moved into `b`, so now `a` cannot be accessed directly here</span>
<span class="c1">// other than through `b`, and `a` is no longer a root.</span>
<span class="c1">// To avoid moving a, passing `a.clone()` to `b` will work</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, we need a way to traverse the object passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>, in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>, and look
for any contained <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>s to unroot. Sound familiar? This needs the same mechanism that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace()</code>
needed! We add struct-walking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unroot()</code> methods to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait which are auto-
derived exactly the same way, and continue. (We don’t need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root()</code> right now, but we will need it
later on).</p>

<p>Now, during collection, we can just traverse the list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcBox</code>s and use the ones with a nonzero
root count as roots for our mark traversal.</p>

<p>So far, so good. We have a pretty sound design for a GC that works … for immutable data.</p>

<h3 id="mutability">Mutability</h3>

<p>Like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> is by default immutable. Rust abhors aliasable mutability, <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">even in single
threaded contexts</a>, and both these smart pointers allow aliasing.</p>

<p>Mutation poses a problem for our GC, beyond the regular problems of aliasable mutability: It’s
possible to move rooted things into heap objects and vice versa:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">None</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// uh oh, x is still considered rooted!</span>

<span class="c1">// and the reverse!</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)));</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="nf">.take</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// x was never rooted!</span>
<span class="c1">// `take()` moves the `Some(Gc&lt;u32&gt;)` out of `y`, replaces it with `None`       </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> doesn’t implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DerefMut</code>, none of this is possible — one cannot mutate the
inner data. This is one of the places where Rust’s ownership/mutability system works out awesomely
in our favor.</p>

<p>Of course, an immutable GC isn’t very useful. We can’t even create cycles in an immutable GC, so why
would anyone need this in the first place<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>?</p>

<p>So of course, we needed to make it somehow mutable. People using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> solve this problem by using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, which maintains something similar to the borrow semantics at runtime and is internally
mutable. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> itself can’t be used by us since it doesn’t guard against the problem
illustrated above (and hence won’t implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>, but a similar cell type would work).</p>

<p>So we created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcCell&lt;T&gt;</code>. This behaves just like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, except that it will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root()</code> before
beginning a mutable borrow, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unroot()</code> before ending it (well, only if it itself is not rooted,
which is tracked by an internal field similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code>). Now, everything is safe:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[derive(Trace)]</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">GcCell</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Gc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">u8</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)});</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="py">.b</span><span class="nf">.borrow_mut</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// the `Gc(30)` from `y.b` was rooted by this call</span>
                           <span class="c1">// but since we don't actually use it here,</span>
                           <span class="c1">// the destructor gets rid of it.</span>
                           <span class="c1">// We could use swap() to retain access to it.</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="c1">// x unrooted</span>
<span class="p">}</span>


<span class="c1">// and the reverse case works too:</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">GcCell</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Gc</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">))));</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="nf">.borrow_mut</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="nf">.take</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// the inner `Some(Gc(20))` gets rooted by `borrow_mut()`</span>
                               <span class="c1">// before `x` can access it</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So now, mutation works too! We have a working garbage collector!</p>

<h1 id="open-problems">Open problems</h1>

<h2 id="destructors">Destructors</h2>

<p>I believe this can be solved without lints, but it <em>may</em> require some upcoming features of Rust to
be implemented first (like specialization).</p>

<p>In essence, destructors implemented on a value inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> can be unsafe. This will only happen
if they try to access values within a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gc&lt;T&gt;</code> — if they do, they may come across a box that
has already been collected, or they may lengthen the lifetime of a box scheduled to be collected.</p>

<p>The basic solution to this is to use “finalizers” instead of destructors. Finalizers, like in Java,
are not guaranteed to run. However, we may need further drop hooks or trait specialization to make
an airtight interface for this. I don’t have a concrete design for this yet, though.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>

<p>Our model mostly just works in a concurrent situation (with thread safety tweaks, of course); in
fact it’s possible to make it so that the concurrent GC will not “stop the world” unless someone
tries to do a write to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GcCell</code>. We have an experimental concurrent GC in <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/pull/6">this pull
request</a>. We still need to figure out how to make interop between both GCs safe, though we may
just end up making them such that an object using one GC cannot be fed to an object using the other.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>So far we haven’t really focused on performance, and worked on ensuring safety. Our collection
triggering algorithm, for example, was horribly inefficient, though we planned on improving it. The
wonderful Huon <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/pull/9">fixed this</a>, though.</p>

<p>Similarly, we haven’t yet optimized storage. We have some ideas which we may work on later. (If you
want to help, contributions welcome!)</p>

<h2 id="cross-crate-deriving">Cross-crate deriving</h2>

<p>Currently, an object deriving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> should have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>able children. This isn’t always possible
when members from another crate (which does not depend on rust-gc) are involved. At the moment, we
allow an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[unsafe_ignore_trace]</code> annotation on fields which are of this type (which excludes it
from being traced – if that crate doesn’t transitively depend on rust-gc, its members cannot
contain GCthings anyway unless generics are involved). It should be possible to detect whether or
not this is safe, and/or autoderive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> using the opt-in builtin traits framework (needs
specialization to work), but at the moment we don’t do anything other than expose that annotation.</p>

<p>Stdlib support for a global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code> trait that everyone derives would be awesome.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Designing a GC was a wonderful experience! I didn’t get to write much code (I was busy and Nika
was able to implement most of it overnight because she’s totally awesome), but the long design
discussions followed by trying to figure out holes in the GC design in every idle moment of the day
were quite enjoyable. GCs are very hard to get right, but it’s very satisfying when you come up with
a design that works! I’m also quite happy at how well Rust helped in making a safe interface.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to try it out and/or find holes in our design. Contributions of all kind
welcome, we’d especially love performance improvements and testcases.</p>
