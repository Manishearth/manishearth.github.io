<div class="entry-content"><p>More than a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">year ago</a> I blogged (and <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/04/50-more-shades-of-green.html">blogged again</a> later) about my
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth">ongoing github streak</a>.</p>

<p>The GitHub streak has since gone on for more than 500 days<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and has been a really enriching experience.</p>

<p>Yesterday; I noticed something. I had reached end-game with this exercise. The streak is something I don&rsquo;t think about anymore,
and I don&rsquo;t make any efforts to keep it going. It just &hellip; happens. My involvement in open source has reached a level where
I don&rsquo;t need to consciously try contributing daily; I have enough interests/responsibilities that the streak is a side effect. This is despite
my current internship being at a place where the code I&rsquo;m working on is not hosted on GitHub (unlike last year). If the streak breaks, I won&rsquo;t
particularly care; and I <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> been caring for a while now.</p>

<p>&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s amazing. Despite me not realizing it at the time, this is the state of affairs that such an exercise would ideally
lead to &mdash; the initial motivation for the exercise replaced with something more substantial, until the excercise is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>I initially started this off after realizing that I had inadvertantly been contributing daily to open source for a week or so. In the past, my
contributions to open source used to be in bursts, which meant that I would be out of touch at times. I decided to try and work on extending this.
After around 30 days, I had a concrete habit. After around 40, I realized that I&rsquo;d become much more efficient at working on random bugs (even in unfamiliar codebases),
thus being able to spend more time writing real code.</p>

<p>Initially I had set a bunch of rules (listed in my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">original post</a>), which had stuff like issues/readme edits not counting (and no date manipulation!). I tweaked the rules around the 80-mark
to include issues/readmes when I had written code that day but it was lost in a commit squash or rebase. I think much later I dropped the rules about issues and readme edits entirely;
just considering &ldquo;anything that shows up on the punchcard which is not a result of date manipulation&rdquo; to be valid. At that point I was already quite involved in multiple projects
and didn&rsquo;t care so much about the streak or the original rules &mdash; it was just a habit at that point.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a regular contributor to both the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> projects. I also have a bunch of personal projects (<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-tenacious">lints</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-extensible">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-adorn">syntax extensions</a> for Rust, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">gc</a>, along with a lot of older projects that I don&rsquo;t actively work on but maintain) and am trying to regularly blog. I&rsquo;ve
also gotten well into the habit of sending pull requests for fixing mistakes or annoyances. When all this comes together, I end up with at least one contribution a day. Sometimes more.
I have tons of things queued that I want to work on (both personal and as a part of Servo/Rust/elsewhere), if only I had the time.</p>

<p>If you do have enough spare time, I do recommend trying this. Once you get enough momentum the power of habit will keep it going, and if
my case is anything of an indicator<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> you&rsquo;ll eventually have a good chunk of contributions and some concrete open source involvement.</p>

<p>Please note that GitHub streaks shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a metric, <em>ever</em>. They&rsquo;re great for self motivation. As a metric for tracking employee performance,
or for filtering interview candidates; not so much. It&rsquo;s way too rough a metric (like LoC written), and oversimplifies the work that goes into code.
As far as using it to boost interview candidates; not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source after a day job in programming,
and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>. I&rsquo;m a physics student &mdash; programming is like a hobby for me<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> which I&rsquo;ll gladly do daily. Now that I have a programming intern,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will be days where I don&rsquo;t want to program further after leaving the office.</p>

<p>The punchcard on GitHub only shows 400-something because the streak got retroactively broken by some deletion or rebase &mdash; at that point I didn&rsquo;t care enough to investigate<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
